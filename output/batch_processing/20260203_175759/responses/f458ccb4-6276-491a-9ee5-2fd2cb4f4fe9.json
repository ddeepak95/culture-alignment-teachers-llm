I need to provide thoughtful responses based on current knowledge about AI in education contexts.\n\nLet me think about each statement:\n\n[TT4G35A]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\n- This is generally true. AI tools can help brainstorm, structure, and improve lesson plans. I would agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35B]: Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- This is true. Adaptive learning systems can personalize content. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35C]: Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\n- This is true. AI can provide personalized feedback and support. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35D]: Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- This is true. AI can provide translations, text-to-speech, etc. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35E]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- This is true. AI can help with grading, attendance, scheduling. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35F]: Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a concern. AI tools can be misused for plagiarism, though it's not unique to AI. This is a legitimate risk. I would agree that this is possible.\n\n[TT4G35G]: Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n- This is true. AI can make errors and recommendations may not always be accurate. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35H]: Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\n- This is a known concern with AI systems. They can perpetuate biases in training data. I would agree with this concern.\n\n[TT4G35I]: Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\n\n\n- Data privacy and security are real risks when AI systems process student information. I would agree this warrants concern.\n\n[TT4G35J]: Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\n- While AI might recommend approaches that don't fit my classroom context, I'd need to exercise professional judgment. This is a potential issue worth acknowledging.\n\nAs a teacher, I want to be balanced here—recognizing both the genuine benefits AI offers for personalization and administrative efficiency, while also taking seriously the risks around data security, bias, plagiarism, and the quality of AI recommendations. My responses reflect a thoughtful educator who sees value but remains cautious about implementation.\n\nI can agree with the positive applications: AI supports lesson planning, content adaptation, student support, accessibility features, and administrative automation. I can also agree with the concerns: AI systems do make errors, carry embedded biases, pose privacy risks, and may suggest pedagogically unsound approaches. I'll structure my responses accordingly.",

                "text": "The user is asking me to respond to a survey about AI in education as if I were a primary or secondary school teacher. I need to provide thoughtful responses based on current knowledge about AI in education contexts.\n\nLet me think about each statement:\n\n[TT4G35A]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\n- This is generally true. AI tools can help brainstorm, structure, and improve lesson plans. I would agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35B]: Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- This is true. Adaptive learning systems can personalize content. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35C]: Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\n- This is true. AI can provide personalized feedback and support. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35D]: Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- This is true. AI can provide translations, text-to-speech, etc. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35E]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- This is true. AI can help with grading, attendance, scheduling. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35F]: Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a concern. AI tools can be misused for plagiarism, though it's not unique to AI. This is a legitimate risk. I would agree that this is possible.\n\n[TT4G35G]: Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n- This is true. AI can make errors and recommendations may not always be accurate. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35H]: Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\n- This is a known concern with AI systems. They can perpetuate biases in training data. I would agree with this concern.\n\n[TT4G35I]: Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\n\n\n- Data privacy and security are real risks when AI systems process student information. I would agree this warrants concern.\n\n[TT4G35J]: Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\n- While AI might recommend approaches that don't fit my classroom context, I'd need to exercise professional judgment. This is a potential issue worth acknowledging.\n\nAs a teacher, I want to be balanced here—recognizing both the genuine benefits AI offers for personalization and administrative efficiency, while also taking seriously the risks around data security, bias, plagiarism, and the quality of AI recommendations. My responses reflect a thoughtful educator who sees value but remains cautious about implementation.\n\nI can agree with the positive applications: AI supports lesson planning, content adaptation, student support, accessibility features, and administrative automation. I can also agree with the concerns: AI systems do make errors, carry embedded biases, pose privacy risks, and may suggest pedagogically unsound approaches. I'll structure my responses accordingly."
