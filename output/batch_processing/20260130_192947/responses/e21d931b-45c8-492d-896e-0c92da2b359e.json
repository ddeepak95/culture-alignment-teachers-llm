I need to provide responses to 10 statements about AI in education. \n\nLet me think about how a thoughtful, balanced teacher might respond to these statements based on realistic perspectives:\n\n1. TT4G35A - \"AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans\" - This is generally true, teachers can use AI tools to assist with planning. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\n2. TT4G35B - \"AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities\" - This is a potential use case, though implementation varies. \"Agree\" seems reasonable.\n\n3. TT4G35C - \"AI assists teachers in supporting students individually\" - AI can provide personalized learning pathways and support, though teacher involvement is crucial. \"Agree\"\n\n4. TT4G35D - \"AI supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs)\" - AI has good potential here with translation tools, text-to-speech, etc. \"Agree\"\n\n5. TT4G35E - \"AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks\" - This is clearly true. Teachers can use AI to help with grading, attendance, scheduling, etc. \"Strongly agree\"\n\n6. TT4G35F - \"AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own\" - This is a real concern with AI tools like ChatGPT. This is a true statement about a problem. \"Strongly agree\" or \"Agree\"\n\n7. TT4G35G - \"AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct\" - This is a known issue with AI systems - hallucinations, errors, inappropriate suggestions. \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\"\n\n8. TT4G35H - \"AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions\" - This is a documented concern with AI systems reflecting training data biases. \"Agree\"\n\n9. TT4G35I - \"AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data\" - This is a legitimate concern, depending on which AI systems and how they're used. \n\nFor the last statement about unsuitable pedagogical approaches, I should also mark \"Agree\" since teachers might uncritically adopt AI suggestions without considering whether they align with sound teaching practices. I want to present responses that reflect both the genuine benefits AI offers in education—like automating routine tasks and personalizing learning—while acknowledging real risks around data security, bias, and the potential for misuse.",
