I should provide thoughtful responses based on realistic perspectives about AI in education. Let me go through each statement:\n\n[TT4G35A]: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - I would agree with this. AI tools can assist with brainstorming and drafting lesson plans.\n\n[TT4G35B]: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - I would agree with this. AI can help personalize content.\n\n[TT4G35C]: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - I would agree with this. AI can provide individualized feedback and support.\n\n[TT4G35D]: AI supports students with specific needs - I would agree with this. AI can help with accessibility and support for diverse learners.\n\n[TT4G35E]: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - I would agree with this. Many administrative tasks could be automated.\n\n[TT4G35F]: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - I would agree with this. This is a legitimate concern about academic integrity.\n\n[TT4G35G]: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - I would agree with this. AI can make errors and inappropriate suggestions.\n\n[TT4G35H]: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - I would agree with this. This is a known concern about AI bias.\n\n[TT4G35I]: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data - I would agree with this. Data privacy is a legitimate concern.\n\n[TT4G35J]: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches - I would agree with this. AI might not always understand best teaching practices.\n\nI should provide balanced responses as a teacher who recognizes both the potential benefits and the genuine risks of AI in education.",
