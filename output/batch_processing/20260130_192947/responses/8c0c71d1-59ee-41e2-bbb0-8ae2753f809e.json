I need to provide responses for each statement using the provided response options: 'Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', 'I don't know'.\n\nLet me think about reasonable responses a teacher from UAE might give to these statements about AI in education:\n\n1. [TT4G35A] - AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans: This is a beneficial use case. I'd agree with this.\n\n2. [TT4G35B] - AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities: This is also a positive capability. I'd agree with this.\n\n3. [TT4G35C] - AI assists teachers in supporting students individually: Another positive capability. I'd agree with this.\n\n4. [TT4G35D] - AI supports students with specific needs: This is beneficial for inclusive education. I'd agree with this.\n\n5. [TT4G35E] - AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks: Definitely helpful for reducing administrative burden. I'd agree with this.\n\n6.
