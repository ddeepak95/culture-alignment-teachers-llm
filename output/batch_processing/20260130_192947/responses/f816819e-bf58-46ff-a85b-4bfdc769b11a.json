I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35B]: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is a known capability of AI systems that can personalize content. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35C]: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - This aligns with adaptive learning and personalized instruction. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35D]: AI supports students with specific needs - AI can indeed help with multilingual learners and students with special needs through accessibility features and personalized support. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35E]: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - This is clearly true (grading, attendance tracking, scheduling, etc.). I would say \"Strongly agree\"\n\n[TT4G35F]: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a risk/concern about academic integrity. This is a valid concern with AI tools like ChatGPT. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35G]: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - This is a valid concern about AI accuracy and reliability. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35H]: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is a known concern about AI bias. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35I]: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data - This is a legitimate concern about data protection. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n\n[TT4G35J]: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches - While AI can offer instructional strategies, they may not always align with sound pedagogy or cultural contexts. I would say \"Agree\"",
