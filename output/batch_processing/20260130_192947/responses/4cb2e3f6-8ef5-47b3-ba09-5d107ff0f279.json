I need to provide one response for each of the 10 statements using the given options: 'Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', or 'I don't know'.\n\nLet me think through each statement:\n\nTT4G35A: \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\"\n- This is generally true. AI tools like ChatGPT can help generate or improve lesson plans. I would agree with this.\n\nTT4G35B: \"Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\"\n- AI can be used for personalized learning and adaptive learning systems. This is largely true. I would agree.\n\nTT4G35C: \"Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\"\n- AI can provide personalized support through tutoring systems, adaptive learning, etc. I would agree with this.\n\nTT4G35D: \"Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\"\n- AI can help with translation, text-to-speech, customized learning paths for students with special needs. I would agree with this.\n\nTT4G35E: \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\"\n- AI can help with grading, attendance, scheduling, etc. This is true. I would agree.\n\nTT4G35F: \"Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\"\n- This is a potential concern. AI tools like ChatGPT can be used for plagiarism. This is a valid concern. I would agree that this is a possibility.\n\nTT4G35G: \"Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\"\n- AI systems can make errors and give inappropriate recommendations. This is a known limitation. I would agree.\n\nTT4G35H: \"Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\"\n\n\n- AI systems can amplify existing biases in training data. This is a known concern. I would agree with this concern.\n\nTT4G35I: \"Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\"\n- This is a legitimate concern with AI systems and data handling. I would agree with this concern.\n\nTT4G35J: \"Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\"\n- AI might suggest approaches that aren't pedagogically sound or appropriate for all contexts. This is a valid concern. I would agree.\n\nI'm forming my responses as a teacher from UAE who recognizes both the practical benefits AI offers for lesson planning, personalization, and administrative efficiency, while also acknowledging legitimate concerns around plagiarism, bias, data security, and pedagogical appropriateness.",

                "text": "I need to respond to a survey about AI in education as a teacher from the United Arab Emirates. I need to provide one response for each of the 10 statements using the given options: 'Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', or 'I don't know'.\n\nLet me think through each statement:\n\nTT4G35A: \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\"\n- This is generally true. AI tools like ChatGPT can help generate or improve lesson plans. I would agree with this.\n\nTT4G35B: \"Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\"\n- AI can be used for personalized learning and adaptive learning systems. This is largely true. I would agree.\n\nTT4G35C: \"Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\"\n- AI can provide personalized support through tutoring systems, adaptive learning, etc. I would agree with this.\n\nTT4G35D: \"Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\"\n- AI can help with translation, text-to-speech, customized learning paths for students with special needs. I would agree with this.\n\nTT4G35E: \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\"\n- AI can help with grading, attendance, scheduling, etc. This is true. I would agree.\n\nTT4G35F: \"Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\"\n- This is a potential concern. AI tools like ChatGPT can be used for plagiarism. This is a valid concern. I would agree that this is a possibility.\n\nTT4G35G: \"Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\"\n- AI systems can make errors and give inappropriate recommendations. This is a known limitation. I would agree.\n\nTT4G35H: \"Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\"\n\n\n- AI systems can amplify existing biases in training data. This is a known concern. I would agree with this concern.\n\nTT4G35I: \"Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\"\n- This is a legitimate concern with AI systems and data handling. I would agree with this concern.\n\nTT4G35J: \"Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\"\n- AI might suggest approaches that aren't pedagogically sound or appropriate for all contexts. This is a valid concern. I would agree.\n\nI'm forming my responses as a teacher from UAE who recognizes both the practical benefits AI offers for lesson planning, personalization, and administrative efficiency, while also acknowledging legitimate concerns around plagiarism, bias, data security, and pedagogical appropriateness."
