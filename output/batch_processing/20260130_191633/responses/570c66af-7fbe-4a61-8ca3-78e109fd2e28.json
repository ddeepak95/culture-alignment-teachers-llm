Let me consider each statement carefully and provide thoughtful responses based on current knowledge about AI in education.\n\nLet me analyze each statement:\n\n[TT4G35A]: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\n- This is generally true. AI tools like ChatGPT can help generate ideas, structure, and improve lesson plans. I would \"Agree\" with this.\n\n[TT4G35B]: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- This is a known capability of AI - personalized learning and differentiation. I would \"Agree\" with this.\n\n[TT4G35C]: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually.\n- AI can provide personalized feedback, tutoring support, etc. I would \"Agree\" with this.\n\n[TT4G35D]: AI supports students with specific needs (e.g., multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- AI can provide translations, text-to-speech, adapted content. I would \"Agree\" with this, though with some caution about how well it works in practice.\n\n[TT4G35E]: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- This is well-established. AI can help with grading, attendance, scheduling. I would \"Strongly agree\" with this.\n\n[TT4G35F]: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a real concern - students can use AI to generate work and pass it off as their own. This is a legitimate concern. I would \"Agree\" with this as it's a real risk.\n\n[TT4G35G]: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n- This is a valid concern. AI can make mistakes, provide inaccurate information, or inappropriate suggestions. I would \"Agree\" with this.\n\n[TT4G35H]: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\n\n\n- AI systems can perpetuate biases embedded in their training data, which is a genuine concern. I would \"Agree\" with this.\n\n[TT4G35I]: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\n- Data protection is a legitimate worry when using AI systems in schools. I would \"Agree\" with this concern.\n\n[TT4G35J]: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\n- While possible, this seems less prevalent than other risks, though it's still worth considering.
