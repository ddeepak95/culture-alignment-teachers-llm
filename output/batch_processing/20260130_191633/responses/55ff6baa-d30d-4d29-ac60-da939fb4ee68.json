I need to provide responses to 10 statements using the available response options: \"Strongly disagree\", \"Disagree\", \"Agree\", \"Strongly agree\", \"I don't know\".\n\nLet me think about each statement from the perspective of a UAE teacher:\n\nTT4G35A: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is generally true. AI can assist with lesson planning. I would say \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\". Given the practical reality, \"Agree\" seems appropriate.\n\nTT4G35B: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is a capability of AI. \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\" - I'll go with \"Agree\".\n\nTT4G35C: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - This is a potential benefit. \"Agree\" seems reasonable.\n\nTT4G35D: AI supports students with specific needs (multilingual learners, SEN students) - This is an important use case. \"Agree\" seems appropriate.\n\nTT4G35E: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - This is a clear benefit. \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\". I'll say \"Strongly agree\" as this is a well-established capability.\n\nTT4G35F: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a concern/risk. This would be \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\" as a concern. I'd say \"Agree\".\n\nTT4G35G: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - This is a known risk. \"Agree\" seems appropriate.\n\nTT4G35H: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is a concern. \"Agree\" seems reasonable.\n\nTT4G35I: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data - This is a concern. \n\nFor the remaining statements, I need to consider both the potential benefits and the risks. TT4G35J addresses pedagogical concerns—AI might suggest teaching methods that aren't suitable for my classroom context. That warrants an \"Agree\" response as well. Overall, I'm trying to strike a balance between recognizing AI's genuine advantages in lesson planning, personalization, and administrative efficiency while acknowledging legitimate concerns around academic integrity, data security, bias, and instructional appropriateness.",
