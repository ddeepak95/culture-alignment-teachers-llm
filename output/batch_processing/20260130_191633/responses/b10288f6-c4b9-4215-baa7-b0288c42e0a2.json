I need to provide responses to 10 statements using the provided response options.\n\nLet me think about each statement from the perspective of a teacher in the UAE:\n\nTT4G35A: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is generally true. AI tools can help generate ideas and improve lesson planning. I would say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35B: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is a strong capability of AI systems. I would say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35C: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - AI can personalize learning. I would say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35D: AI supports students with specific needs - This is increasingly possible with AI tools. I would say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35E: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - This is a known benefit of AI. I would say \"Strongly agree\"\n\nTT4G35F: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a concern about AI enabling plagiarism/academic dishonesty. I would say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35G: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - This is a valid concern about AI limitations.

I would say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35I: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data - This is a legitimate concern in the UAE context where data privacy is important. I would say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35J: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students - This is a concern about AI not understanding good teaching practices.
