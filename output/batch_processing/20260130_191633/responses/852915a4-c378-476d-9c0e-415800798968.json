I need to provide responses to all 10 statements listed (TT4G35A through TT4G35J).\n\nLet me think through each statement carefully:\n\n[TT4G35A]: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is generally true. AI tools can assist in generating ideas, structuring content, etc. I would agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35B]: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is a capability that AI can provide through personalization and adaptive learning systems. I would agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35C]: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - AI can provide individualized feedback, tutoring support, etc. This seems reasonable. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35D]: AI supports students with specific needs - AI can help with text-to-speech, translation, adaptive interfaces, etc. This is true. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35E]: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - Yes, AI can help with grading, attendance, data entry, etc. I would strongly agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35F]: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a valid concern. AI can be used to generate content that students could pass off as their own. I would agree with this concern.\n\n[TT4G35G]: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - This is a valid concern. AI can make mistakes or provide inappropriate suggestions. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35H]: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is a known issue with AI systems. They can perpetuate biases in training data. I would agree with this concern.\n\n[TT4G35I]: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data - This is a legitimate concern about data collection and storage. I would agree.\n\n\n[TT4G35J]: AI suggesting pedagogical approaches that don't align with established best practices is also a real risk I'd need to watch for. I need to strike a balance between recognizing genuine benefits like lesson planning support and administrative efficiency, while remaining cautious about risks around academic integrity, data security, and whether AI recommendations actually serve my students' learning needs.",
