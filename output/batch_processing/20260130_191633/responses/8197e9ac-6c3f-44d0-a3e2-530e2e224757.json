I should consider both the potential benefits and risks of AI in educational contexts.\n\nLet me think through each statement:\n\n[TT4G35A]: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\n- This is generally true. AI tools can assist with generating ideas, structures, and content for lesson plans. I would **Agree** with this.\n\n[TT4G35B]: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- AI can analyze student performance and suggest adaptations. This is a realistic capability. I would **Agree** with this.\n\n[TT4G35C]: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually.\n- AI can provide personalized learning tools and adaptive systems. This is true. I would **Agree** with this.\n\n[TT4G35D]: AI supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- AI can help with translation, text-to-speech, adapted content. This is a real benefit. I would **Strongly agree** with this as it's a particularly important use case.\n\n[TT4G35E]: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- Yes, AI can help with grading, scheduling, attendance tracking, etc. I would **Strongly agree** with this.\n\n[TT4G35F]: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a genuine risk. AI tools like ChatGPT can generate text that students could submit as their own or modify from others' work. I would **Strongly agree** with this risk.\n\n[TT4G35G]: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n- Yes, AI systems can make errors and inappropriate suggestions. This is a real concern. I would **Strongly agree** with this.\n\n[TT4G35H]: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\n\n\n- AI systems can perpetuate existing biases in their training data, which is a documented concern.
