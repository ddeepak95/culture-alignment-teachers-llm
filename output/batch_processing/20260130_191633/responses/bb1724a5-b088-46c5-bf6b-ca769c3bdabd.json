I need to provide responses to 10 statements about AI in education.\n\nLet me think about these statements from the perspective of a teacher in the UAE:\n\n[TT4G35A]: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is generally true. AI tools can help generate ideas and structure for lesson plans. I would **Agree**.\n\n[TT4G35B]: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is a capability that AI has, though it requires proper implementation. I would **Agree**.\n\n[TT4G35C]: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - AI tools can provide personalized learning, but teachers remain central. I would **Agree**.\n\n[TT4G35D]: AI supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs) - AI can be helpful for accessibility and personalized learning for these groups. I would **Agree**.\n\n[TT4G35E]: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - This is definitely true. AI can help with grading, scheduling, etc. I would **Strongly agree**.\n\n[TT4G35F]: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a legitimate concern. AI can be misused for plagiarism. I would **Agree** or **Strongly agree**. I'll go with **Agree** as it's a potential issue.\n\n[TT4G35G]: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - This is a valid concern. AI is not perfect. I would **Agree**.\n\n[TT4G35H]: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is a known issue with AI systems. I would **Agree**.\n\n[TT4G35I]: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data - This is a valid concern, though it depends on implementation. \n\n[TT4G35J]: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students - This is a concern about the quality of AI recommendations. I would **Agree**.\n\nI should provide balanced responses that acknowledge both the genuine benefits AI offers for lesson planning and personalized learning, as well as the real risks around data security, bias, and the quality of AI-generated suggestions.",
