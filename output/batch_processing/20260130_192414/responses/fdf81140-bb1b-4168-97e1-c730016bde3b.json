I need to provide responses to 10 statements about AI in education.\n\nLet me think about each statement from the perspective of a thoughtful educator:\n\n[TT4G35A]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\n- This is generally true. AI tools can assist in brainstorming, organizing, and improving lesson plans. I would agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35B]: Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- AI can analyze student performance and suggest differentiated materials. This is a legitimate capability. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35C]: Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\n- AI can provide personalized learning paths and support. This is a known capability. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35D]: Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- AI can help with translation, text-to-speech, and adapted learning materials. This is true. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35E]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- AI can help with grading automation, attendance, scheduling, etc. This is clearly true. I would strongly agree or agree.\n\n[TT4G35F]: Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is unfortunately true - students could use AI to generate work and claim it as their own. I would agree with this concern.\n\n[TT4G35G]: Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n- This is a valid concern. AI systems can make errors and inappropriate suggestions. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35H]: Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\n- This is a known risk with AI systems - they can perpetuate biases in their training data. I would agree.\n\n\n- Data privacy represents a genuine risk when implementing AI in schools, as these systems process sensitive student information. I would agree with this concern.\n- AI might recommend teaching methods that don't align with sound pedagogical principles or classroom realities. This is worth considering carefully as an educator.",
