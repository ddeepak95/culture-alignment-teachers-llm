AI tools like ChatGPT can help brainstorm and generate lesson plan ideas. I'd agree with this.\n\nTT4G35B: Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- AI can certainly help with differentiation and personalized learning paths.

I'd agree.\n\nTT4G35D: Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- AI has potential here with translation tools, text-to-speech, accessibility features. This is a positive application. I'd agree.\n\nTT4G35E: Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- Yes, AI can help with grading, scheduling, data entry. This is a practical benefit. I'd strongly agree.\n\nTT4G35F: Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is true - students can use AI to generate work that appears to be their own. This is a risk/concern, so I'd agree with this statement (acknowledging it as a problem).\n\nTT4G35G: Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n- Yes, AI can make mistakes and provide inappropriate recommendations. \n\nTT4G35H: Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\n- This is a known issue with AI - biases in training data can be reflected in outputs. I'd agree with this concern.\n\nTT4G35I: Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\n- This is a legitimate concern about data privacy with AI systems. I'd agree with this concern.\n\nTT4G35J: Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\n- AI might not always understand sound teaching practices. This is a valid concern. I'd agree.\n\nI'm recognizing both the genuine benefits AI offers—from streamlining administrative work to personalizing student support—and the real risks it poses, particularly around academic integrity, data security, and algorithmic bias.
