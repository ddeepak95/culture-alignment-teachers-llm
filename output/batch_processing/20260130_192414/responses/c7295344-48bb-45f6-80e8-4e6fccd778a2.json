I need to provide my responses using the json_tool_call function with appropriate agreement levels.\n\nLet me think about reasonable responses from the perspective of an educator in the UAE:\n\nTT4G35A: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is generally true, AI tools can assist in creating lesson plans. I would say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35B: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is a capability of AI, though implementation varies. I would say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35C: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - This is possible through personalized learning systems. I would say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35D: AI supports students with specific needs (multilingual learners, students with SEN) - This is true, AI can help with translation and adapted content. I would say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35E: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - Definitely true, this is one of the main benefits. I would say \"Strongly agree\"\n\nTT4G35F: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a risk/concern about AI (related to plagiarism and misuse). I would say \"Agree\" (acknowledging this is a real concern)\n\nTT4G35G: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - This is a known limitation of AI. I would say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35H: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is a concern with AI systems. I would say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35I: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data - This is a valid concern about data handling. I would say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35J: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students - This is a concern about the appropriateness of AI recommendations. \n\nI would say \"Agree\" as well. I need to balance my responses to reflect both the genuine advantages AI offers in lesson planning, personalization, and administrative efficiency, alongside the legitimate concerns around data security, bias, and the quality of AI-generated recommendations.",
