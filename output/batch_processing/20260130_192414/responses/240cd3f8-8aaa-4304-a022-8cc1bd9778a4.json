I need to provide responses for each of the 10 statements (TT4G35A through TT4G35J).\n\nAs a teacher from UAE responding to these statements, I should provide thoughtful responses based on practical educational experience. Let me consider each statement:\n\nTT4G35A: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is generally true, AI can assist with lesson planning. I would say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35B: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is a known capability of AI for personalization. I would say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35C: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - AI can help with personalized learning support. I would say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35D: AI supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs) - AI has potential here, particularly for language support and accessibility. I would say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35E: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - This is definitely true, scheduling, grading, etc. I would say \"Strongly agree\"\n\nTT4G35F: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a concern about academic integrity/plagiarism. This is true - AI can facilitate this. I would say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35G: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - This is a valid concern. AI can make errors. I would say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35H: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is a valid concern about bias in AI. I would say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35I: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data - This is a legitimate concern. I would say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35J: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students - This is a concern about inappropriate recommendations. \n\nFor the final statement, I also agree that AI can propose pedagogical methods that don't align with effective teaching practices. My responses will reflect both the genuine advantages AI offers for lesson design, personalization, and administrative efficiency, as well as the legitimate risks around academic integrity, data security, algorithmic bias, and the quality of AI-generated recommendations.",
