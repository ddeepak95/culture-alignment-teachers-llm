I should provide thoughtful responses based on what a teacher in that context might realistically think about AI in education.\n\nLet me consider each statement:\n\n[TT4G35A] - Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\nThis is generally a positive use of AI. As a teacher, I would likely agree that AI can assist with this practical task.\n\n[TT4G35B] - Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\nThis is another positive application. Differentiated instruction is important and AI could help with this.\n\n[TT4G35C] - Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\nThis is positive - personalized learning support is valuable.\n\n[TT4G35D] - Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\nThis is positive and particularly relevant. In Morocco, with diverse student populations, this could be very helpful.\n\n[TT4G35E] - Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\nThis is clearly positive and most teachers would appreciate help with administrative burden.\n\n[TT4G35F] - Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\nThis is a negative statement about academic integrity. As a teacher, I would strongly agree with this - AI does create opportunities for plagiarism and cheating.\n\n[TT4G35G] - Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\nThis is a valid concern. AI can make mistakes and inappropriate suggestions. I would agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35H] - Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\nThis is a valid concern about bias in AI. I would likely agree or strongly agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35I] - Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\n\n\nData protection is a serious concern for educators. I would agree that this is a legitimate risk.\n\n[TT4G35J] - Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\nAI might recommend teaching methods that don't align with sound educational practice. I would likely agree with this concern.\n\nAs a Moroccan teacher, I should be balanced - recognizing both the genuine benefits AI offers for lesson preparation, personalization, and supporting diverse learners, while also acknowledging real risks around academic integrity, data privacy, algorithmic bias, and pedagogical appropriateness.",

I should provide thoughtful responses based on what a teacher in that context might realistically think about AI in education.\n\nLet me consider each statement:\n\n[TT4G35A] - Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\nThis is generally a positive use of AI. As a teacher, I would likely agree that AI can assist with this practical task.\n\n[TT4G35B] - Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\nThis is another positive application. Differentiated instruction is important and AI could help with this.\n\n[TT4G35C] - Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\nThis is positive - personalized learning support is valuable.\n\n[TT4G35D] - Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\nThis is positive and particularly relevant. In Morocco, with diverse student populations, this could be very helpful.\n\n[TT4G35E] - Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\nThis is clearly positive and most teachers would appreciate help with administrative burden.\n\n[TT4G35F] - Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\nThis is a negative statement about academic integrity. As a teacher, I would strongly agree with this - AI does create opportunities for plagiarism and cheating.\n\n[TT4G35G] - Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\nThis is a valid concern. AI can make mistakes and inappropriate suggestions. I would agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35H] - Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\nThis is a valid concern about bias in AI. I would likely agree or strongly agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35I] - Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\n\n\nData protection is a serious concern for educators. I would agree that this is a legitimate risk.\n\n[TT4G35J] - Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\nAI might recommend teaching methods that don't align with sound educational practice. I would likely agree with this concern.\n\nAs a Moroccan teacher, I should be balanced - recognizing both the genuine benefits AI offers for lesson preparation, personalization, and supporting diverse learners, while also acknowledging real risks around academic integrity, data privacy, algorithmic bias, and pedagogical appropriateness."
