I need to provide responses to 10 statements about AI in education.\n\nLet me think about each statement from the perspective of a Korean school teacher who would likely have a balanced but somewhat cautious view of AI integration in education:\n\n[TT4G35A]: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is a reasonable positive use case. Teachers would likely \"Agree\" that this is a benefit.\n\n[TT4G35B]: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is another positive potential use. Teachers would likely \"Agree\" with this.\n\n[TT4G35C]: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - This is a positive application. Teachers would likely \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35D]: AI supports students with specific needs (multilingual learners, special education needs) - This is a positive use for accessibility.

Teachers would likely \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35J]: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students - This is a concern about quality of AI suggestions. \n\nFor the final statement, I'd likely \"Agree\" or remain uncertain about this risk. As a Korean teacher, I should balance acknowledging genuine benefits like personalized learning and administrative efficiency with legitimate concerns around data security, bias, and academic integrity. My responses would reflect cautious optimism—recognizing AI's potential while maintaining healthy skepticism about its limitations and risks.",
