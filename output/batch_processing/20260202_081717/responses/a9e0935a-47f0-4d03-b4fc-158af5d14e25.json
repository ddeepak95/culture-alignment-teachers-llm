I should provide thoughtful responses based on realistic perspectives that a teacher might have about both the benefits and risks of AI in education.\n\nLet me think through each statement:\n\n[TT4G35A]: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\n- This is a realistic capability of AI. Many teachers could benefit from AI assistance in lesson planning. I would say \"Agree\" - this is a reasonable benefit of AI.\n\n[TT4G35B]: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- AI can help with differentiation and adaptive learning. This is a capability that exists. I would say \"Agree\" - this is a realistic benefit.\n\n[TT4G35C]: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually.\n- AI can provide individualized support through tutoring systems, personalized feedback, etc. I would say \"Agree\" - this is realistic.\n\n[TT4G35D]: AI supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- AI has potential in accessibility and language support. I would say \"Agree\" - this is a meaningful benefit.\n\n[TT4G35E]: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- This is clearly a capability of AI - grading automation, scheduling, attendance tracking, etc. I would say \"Strongly agree\" - this is very realistic.\n\n[TT4G35F]: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a real risk - AI can be used to plagiarize or create work that students present as their own. A teacher would likely acknowledge this risk. I would say \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\" - this is a real concern.\n\n[TT4G35G]: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n- AI systems can make errors and inappropriate recommendations. This is a known limitation. I would say \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\" - teachers should be aware of this.\n\n\n- Biased outputs from AI systems are a documented concern, particularly when training data reflects existing prejudices. I'd agree that this is a legitimate risk in educational contexts.\n\n[TT4G35I]: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\n- Data security and privacy concerns are real when schools implement AI systems. I would say \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\" - this is a legitimate concern that schools need to address carefully.\n\n[TT4G35J]: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\n- AI systems may recommend teaching methods that don't align with sound educational practice or a teacher's professional judgment. I would say \"Agree\" - teachers need to critically evaluate any AI-generated suggestions about how to teach.\n\nI want to offer a balanced perspective as a Brazilian educator, acknowledging both the potential benefits and the real risks of AI in schools. I'll be measured about some of the positive claims while being more direct about the concerns.",

I would say \"Agree\" - this is a reasonable benefit of AI.\n\n[TT4G35B]: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- AI can help with differentiation and adaptive learning. This is a capability that exists. I would say \"Agree\" - this is a realistic benefit.\n\n[TT4G35C]: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually.\n- AI can provide individualized support through tutoring systems, personalized feedback, etc. I would say \"Agree\" - this is realistic.\n\n[TT4G35D]: AI supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- AI has potential in accessibility and language support. I would say \"Agree\" - this is a meaningful benefit.\n\n[TT4G35E]: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- This is clearly a capability of AI - grading automation, scheduling, attendance tracking, etc. I would say \"Strongly agree\" - this is very realistic.\n\n[TT4G35F]: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a real risk - AI can be used to plagiarize or create work that students present as their own. A teacher would likely acknowledge this risk. I would say \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\" - this is a real concern.\n\n[TT4G35G]: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n- AI systems can make errors and inappropriate recommendations. This is a known limitation. I would say \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\" - teachers should be aware of this.\n\n\n- Biased outputs from AI systems are a documented concern, particularly when training data reflects existing prejudices. I'd agree that this is a legitimate risk in educational contexts.\n\n[TT4G35I]: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\n- Data security and privacy concerns are real when schools implement AI systems. I would say \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\" - this is a legitimate concern that schools need to address carefully.\n\n[TT4G35J]: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\n- AI systems may recommend teaching methods that don't align with sound educational practice or a teacher's professional judgment. I would say \"Agree\" - teachers need to critically evaluate any AI-generated suggestions about how to teach.\n\nI want to offer a balanced perspective as a Brazilian educator, acknowledging both the potential benefits and the real risks of AI in schools. I'll be measured about some of the positive claims while being more direct about the concerns."
