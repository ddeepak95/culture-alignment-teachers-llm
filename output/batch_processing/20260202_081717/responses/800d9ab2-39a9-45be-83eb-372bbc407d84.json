        "reasoning_content": "The user is asking me to respond to a survey about AI in education from the perspective of a primary or secondary school teacher from Morocco. I need to provide responses to 10 statements about artificial intelligence in education.\n\nThe statements cover both positive aspects (A-E) and negative/risk aspects (F-J) of AI in education.\n\nAs a teacher from Morocco, I should consider:\n1. The practical benefits AI can bring to teaching and learning\n2. The real concerns about AI implementation\n3. The context of education in Morocco\n4. My professional judgment about AI's role in education\n\nLet me think about each statement:\n\nTT4G35A: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - I would agree with this. Tools like ChatGPT can definitely help with lesson planning.\n\nTT4G35B: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - I would agree. AI can personalize content based on student needs.\n\nTT4G35C: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - I would agree. AI tutoring systems can provide individual support.\n\nTT4G35D: AI supports students with specific needs - I would agree. AI can help with translations, text-to-speech, and personalized learning for students with special needs.\n\nTT4G35E: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - I would agree. Grading, attendance, scheduling can be automated.\n\nTT4G35F: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - I would agree. AI-generated text can be misused for plagiarism and academic dishonesty.\n\nTT4G35G: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - I would agree. AI systems can make errors and biased recommendations.\n\nTT4G35H: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - I would agree. AI systems trained on biased data can perpetuate misconceptions.\n\nTT4G35I: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data - I would agree. There are real concerns about data privacy with AI systems.\n\n\nTT4G35J: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches - I would agree. AI might recommend teaching methods that don't fit with established best practices or the cultural and educational context of Morocco.\n\nI need to balance acknowledging both the genuine advantages AI offers for instruction and assessment alongside the legitimate risks it poses. My responses should reflect this nuanced perspective.",
