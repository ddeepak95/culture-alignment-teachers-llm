I need to provide responses to 10 statements about AI.\n\nLet me think about reasonable responses from the perspective of a thoughtful teacher who has considered both the benefits and risks of AI:\n\nTT4G35A - \"AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans\" - This is generally true. AI tools can help generate ideas and improve lesson planning. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35B - \"AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities\" - This is a key benefit of AI. I'd say \"Strongly agree\"\n\nTT4G35C - \"AI assists teachers in supporting students individually\" - Yes, AI can help with personalized learning. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35D - \"AI supports students with specific needs\" - AI has real potential here. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35E - \"AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks\" - This is definitely true and a significant benefit. I'd say \"Strongly agree\"\n\nTT4G35F - \"AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own\" - This is unfortunately true, a concern with AI. I'd say \"Agree\" (this is about the risk)\n\nTT4G35G - \"AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct\" - Yes, AI can make mistakes. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35H - \"AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions\" - This is a known concern. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35I - \"AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data\" - This is a legitimate concern. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35J - \"AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students\" - This could happen.
