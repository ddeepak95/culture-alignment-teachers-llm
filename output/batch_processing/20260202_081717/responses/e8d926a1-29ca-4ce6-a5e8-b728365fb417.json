I need to provide responses to 10 statements about AI in education.\n\nLet me think about each statement from the perspective of a Hungarian school teacher:\n\n[TT4G35A]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\n- This is generally true - AI tools can assist with lesson planning. I would agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35B]: Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- This is also true - AI can help personalize content. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35C]: Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\n- Yes, AI can provide individualized support. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35D]: Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- This is true - AI can help with accessibility and specialized support. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35E]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- Definitely true - AI can help with grading, scheduling, etc. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35F]: Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a valid concern - AI can be used for plagiarism/academic dishonesty. I would agree this is a risk.\n\n[TT4G35G]: Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n- This is true - AI can make errors. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35H]: Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\n- This is a concern - AI can reflect biases in training data. I would agree this is a risk.\n\n[TT4G35I]: Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\n- This is a valid concern about data privacy. I would agree this is a risk.\n\n\n[TT4G35J]: Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\n- AI could recommend teaching methods that don't align with best practices or student needs. This is a legitimate concern I'd acknowledge.\n\nI'm recognizing that the first five statements highlight genuine advantages—AI can streamline lesson preparation, customize instruction for diverse learners, and reduce administrative burden. The remaining five point to real risks worth taking seriously: academic dishonesty, algorithmic errors, embedded biases, data security threats, and potentially misguided pedagogical suggestions. My responses should reflect agreement with both the benefits and the validity of these concerns.",
