I need to provide responses to 10 statements about AI in education using the response options: 'Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', 'I don't know'.\n\nLet me think about reasonable responses from a teacher's perspective:\n\n1. [TT4G35A]: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is a positive statement about AI capabilities. I think a teacher would likely agree with this as AI tools can indeed assist with lesson planning. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\n2. [TT4G35B]: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is about personalization and differentiation. This is a known capability of AI. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\n3. [TT4G35C]: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - Similar to B, this is about individual support. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\n4. [TT4G35D]: AI supports students with specific needs - This is about accessibility and special needs. AI can help with translation, text-to-speech, etc. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\n5. [TT4G35E]: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - This is true, AI can help with grading, scheduling, etc. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\n6. [TT4G35F]: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work - This is a risk/concern about academic integrity. This is a valid concern. I'll say \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\" - this is a real concern for educators.\n\n7. [TT4G35G]: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - This is about accuracy and appropriateness of AI recommendations. This is a valid concern. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\n8. [TT4G35H]: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is about bias in AI. This is a known concern. \n\nFor the remaining concerns about data privacy, unsuitable pedagogical approaches, and whether AI recommendations might be inappropriate—these are all legitimate worries from an educator's standpoint. I'd agree with these as well, reflecting both the genuine benefits AI offers for instruction and administration, while also acknowledging the real risks around academic integrity, accuracy, bias, and student data protection.",
