I should consider both the benefits and risks of AI in education.\n\nLet me go through each statement:\n\nTT4G35A: \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\" - This is a positive application. AI can indeed help with this. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35B: \"Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\" - This is also a positive capability of AI.

I'll say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35E: \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\" - This is a practical benefit. I'll say \"Strongly agree\" as this is quite clear\n\nTT4G35F: \"Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\" - This is a risk/negative statement. I should agree with this as it's a real concern. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35G: \"Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\" - This is also a risk. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35H: \"Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\" - This is a concern. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\n\nFor the remaining statements, I need to address data protection concerns and pedagogical risks. Data privacy is a significant issue when using AI systems with student information, so I'll mark that as \"Agree\". Similarly, AI might suggest teaching methods that don't align with sound educational practice, which is also a valid concern worth acknowledging.",
