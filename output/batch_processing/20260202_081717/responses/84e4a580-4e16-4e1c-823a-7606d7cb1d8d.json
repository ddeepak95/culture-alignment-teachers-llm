These statements cover both positive and negative aspects of AI in education. Let me think through each one carefully:\n\nTT4G35A - AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans: This is generally true and a beneficial application. I would agree.\n\nTT4G35B - AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities: This is a potential benefit of AI. I would agree.\n\nTT4G35C - AI assists teachers in supporting students individually: This is a reasonable application. I would agree.\n\nTT4G35D - AI supports students with specific needs: This is a valuable application. I would agree.\n\nTT4G35E - AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks: This is a clear benefit. I would agree.\n\nTT4G35F - AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own: This is a concern/risk. I would agree that this is a problem.\n\nTT4G35G - AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct: This is a legitimate concern. I would agree.\n\nTT4G35H - AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions: This is a known concern with AI. I would agree.\n\nTT4G35I - AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data: This is a significant concern. I would agree.\n\nTT4G35J - AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students: This is a concern. I would agree.\n\nAs a Swedish teacher, I would likely be thoughtful about both benefits and risks. I'll provide balanced responses that reflect both the positive potential and legitimate concerns about AI in education. Swedish education values equity, inclusion, and critical thinking, so I would be concerned about issues like bias, privacy, and unsuitable approaches.\n\nLet me provide responses that are realistic for a Swedish teacher who recognizes both opportunities and challenges:",
