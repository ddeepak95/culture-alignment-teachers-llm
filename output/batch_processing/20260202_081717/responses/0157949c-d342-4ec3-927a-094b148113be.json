I need to provide responses to 10 statements about AI in education.\n\nLet me think about reasonable responses from the perspective of a teacher who would have experience with educational technology:\n\n[TT4G35A]: \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\" - This is a positive use case. Teachers would likely agree with this as AI can provide suggestions and assistance. I'll respond with \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35B]: \"Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\" - This is another positive use case. AI can help personalize learning. I'll respond with \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35C]: \"Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\" - Again a positive use case.

I think most teachers would agree this is a potential issue.

I'll respond with \"Agree\".\n\n\nFor the remaining statements, data privacy and pedagogical concerns are also legitimate worries. AI systems can pose risks to student information security, and the algorithmic suggestions for teaching methods might not always align with sound educational practices.
