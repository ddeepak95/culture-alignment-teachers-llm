Most teachers would agree this is helpful. I'll respond \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35B: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is also a positive application. I'll respond \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35C: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - Positive application. I'll respond \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35D: AI supports students with specific needs - This is helpful for inclusion.

I'll respond \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35F: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a concern about academic dishonesty. Most teachers would agree this is a real concern.

I'll respond \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35I: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data - This is a significant concern for teachers. I'll respond \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35J: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches - This is a concern about AI understanding teaching methodology. \n\nFor this final statement, I'll also respond \"Agree\" since it reflects legitimate concerns about whether AI truly grasps effective teaching practices.
