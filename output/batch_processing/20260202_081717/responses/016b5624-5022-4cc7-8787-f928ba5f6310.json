I need to provide responses to each of the 10 statements about AI in education.\n\nLet me think about reasonable responses from a teacher's perspective for each statement:\n\n[TT4G35A]: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is generally true. AI tools can assist with creating or refining lesson plans. A teacher would likely agree or strongly agree with this positive application.\n\n[TT4G35B]: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is a known capability of AI in personalized learning. A teacher would likely agree with this positive application.\n\n[TT4G35C]: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - This is also a recognized positive use of AI. A teacher would likely agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35D]: AI supports students with specific needs - This is a valuable application for accessibility. A teacher would likely agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35E]: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - This is a known use case. Teachers often struggle with administrative work, so they would likely agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35F]: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a concern/risk. A teacher would likely agree that this is a potential issue, as this is a known risk of AI tools like ChatGPT.\n\n[TT4G35G]: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - This is also a known limitation. A teacher would likely agree that AI can make errors or unsuitable recommendations.\n\n[TT4G35H]: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is a concern about bias in AI. A teacher would likely agree this is a potential issue.\n\n[TT4G35I]: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data - This is a valid concern. A teacher would likely agree this is a risk, especially given recent data privacy issues.\n\n[TT4G35J]: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches - This is a concern about AI not understanding proper teaching methods. \n\nA teacher would likely recognize this as a valid risk. I should provide balanced responses acknowledging both the genuine benefits AI offers—like streamlining lesson planning, personalizing instruction, and reducing administrative burden—while also recognizing legitimate concerns around academic integrity, accuracy, bias, and data security. For the positive applications, I'll indicate agreement, and for the risk statements, I'll acknowledge these as reasonable concerns teachers would have.",
