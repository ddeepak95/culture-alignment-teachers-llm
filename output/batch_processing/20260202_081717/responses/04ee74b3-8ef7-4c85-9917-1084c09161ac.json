I need to provide responses to 10 statements about the use of artificial intelligence in education.\n\nLet me think about reasonable responses from the perspective of a Chilean teacher who is thoughtful about both benefits and risks of AI in education:\n\n1. [TT4G35A] - AI helping with lesson plans: This is a generally positive and realistic use case. I would say \"Agree\" - AI can indeed help with this task.\n\n2. [TT4G35B] - AI adapting material to students' abilities: This is also a positive use case that has real potential. I would say \"Agree\" - this is a promising application.\n\n3. [TT4G35C] - AI assisting with individual student support: Another beneficial use case. I would say \"Agree\" - AI can help with personalized support.\n\n4. [TT4G35D] - AI supporting students with specific needs: This is very positive and important. I would say \"Agree\" - AI has potential for accessibility and inclusion.\n\n5. [TT4G35E] - AI automating administrative tasks: This is realistic and beneficial. I would say \"Agree\" - teachers do have administrative burden that AI could help with.\n\n6. [TT4G35F] - AI enabling academic dishonesty: This is a real risk. I would say \"Agree\" - this is a legitimate concern about AI tools.\n\n7. [TT4G35G] - AI making inappropriate recommendations: This is a real risk to be aware of. I would say \"Agree\" - AI systems can make errors or inappropriate suggestions.\n\n8. [TT4G35H] - AI amplifying biases: This is a documented concern. I would say \"Agree\" - this is a real risk with AI systems.\n\n9. [TT4G35I] - AI jeopardizing privacy and security: This is a legitimate concern for student data. I would say \"Agree\" - this is a real concern about data protection.\n\n\n10. [TT4G35J] - AI suggesting unsuitable pedagogical approaches: I would say \"Agree\" - AI systems may not fully grasp contextual teaching practices.\n\nI see genuine value in AI for lesson planning, personalization, and administrative support, but I'm equally aware of the risks around academic integrity, bias, data security, and pedagogical appropriateness.
