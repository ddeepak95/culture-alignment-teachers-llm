I need to provide one response for each statement from the options: 'Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', 'I don't know'.\n\nLet me think about appropriate responses as a teacher from Shanghai:\n\nTT4G35A - AI helps teachers write/improve lesson plans: This is generally true. AI can be helpful for this. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35B - AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities: This is a positive capability of AI. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35C - AI assists in supporting students individually: AI can help with personalized learning. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35D - AI supports students with specific needs: AI tools can help with accessibility and support for diverse learners. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35E - AI helps automate administrative tasks: Yes, this is a well-established use case. I'd say \"Strongly agree\"\n\nTT4G35F - AI enables students to misrepresent others' work: This is a concern, but it's not what AI \"does\" - it's a misuse of it. However, it is enabled by AI tools. I'd say \"Agree\" - acknowledging this as a real concern\n\nTT4G35G - AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate/correct: This is a valid concern. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35H - AI amplifies biases: This is a known issue with AI systems. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35I - AI jeopardises privacy/security of student data: This is a legitimate concern. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35J - AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches: This could happen. I'd say \"Agree\" or \"Disagree\" - I think there's some truth to this but it's not guaranteed. \n\nFor this last one, I'll go with \"Agree\" since AI systems may lack understanding of effective teaching methods and context-specific practices. Overall, I'm trying to balance recognition of AI's genuine benefits with awareness of its real limitations and risks in an educational setting.",
