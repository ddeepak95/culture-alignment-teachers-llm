I need to provide my response to each of the 10 statements using the provided function. Let me think about reasonable responses for each statement from the perspective of a teacher:\n\nTT4G35A - AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans: This is generally true. Agree.\n\nTT4G35B - AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities: This is a positive capability of AI. Agree.\n\nTT4G35C - AI assists teachers in supporting students individually: This is potential but requires proper implementation. Agree.\n\nTT4G35D - AI supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, special education needs): This has potential. Agree.\n\nTT4G35E - AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks: This is clearly true. Strongly agree.\n\nTT4G35F - AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own: This is a real concern with AI tools like ChatGPT. Strongly agree (that this is a problem).\n\nTT4G35G - AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct: This is a valid concern. Agree.\n\nTT4G35H - AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions: This is a known issue with AI. Agree.\n\nTT4G35I - AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data: This is a legitimate concern. Agree.\n\nTT4G35J - AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students: This could happen. Agree or Disagree - I'll go with Agree as it's a possible concern.\n\nLet me prepare the function calls with these responses.",
