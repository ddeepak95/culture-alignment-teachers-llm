        "reasoning_content": "I need to respond to this survey as a primary or secondary school teacher from Brazil regarding AI in education. Let me go through each statement and provide thoughtful responses based on a realistic teacher's perspective.\n\nLet me think about each statement:\n\n[TT4G35A]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\n- This is a benefit statement. AI tools can help with lesson planning. I would say \"Agree\" - this is a reasonable use case for AI in education.\n\n[TT4G35B]: Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- This is a benefit statement about personalization. AI can help with adaptive learning. I would say \"Agree\" - this is a known capability of AI systems.\n\n[TT4G35C]: Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\n- This is a benefit statement about individual support. AI could provide personalized feedback and support. I would say \"Agree\" - this is feasible.\n\n[TT4G35D]: Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- This is a benefit statement about supporting diverse learners. AI can provide language support and adapted content. I would say \"Strongly agree\" - this is a strong use case for AI.\n\n[TT4G35E]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- This is a benefit statement about administrative efficiency. AI can help with grading, attendance, scheduling, etc. I would say \"Agree\" - this is definitely a capability.\n\n[TT4G35F]: Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a risk statement about academic dishonesty. AI tools like ChatGPT can be used to plagiarize. As a teacher, I would be concerned about this. I would say \"Strongly agree\" - this is a real concern.\n\n[TT4G35G]: Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n\n\n- AI systems have reliability issues and can produce inaccurate or unsuitable suggestions. I would say \"Agree\" - this is a documented limitation.\n\n[TT4G35H]: Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\n- AI can perpetuate biases embedded in training data, which is a significant concern. I would say \"Agree\" - this is a known problem with AI systems.\n\n[TT4G35I]: Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\n- Data protection is a major concern when implementing AI in schools. I would say \"Strongly agree\" - this is a critical issue.\n\n[TT4G35J]: Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\n- AI might recommend teaching methods that lack evidence-based support or don't fit the specific context. I would say \"Agree\" - this is a legitimate risk worth considering.\n\nI'm trying to be balanced here—acknowledging that these are real concerns while recognizing that AI does have potential benefits in education. As a teacher, I need to be cautious about these limitations and use AI thoughtfully rather than uncritically.",

                "text": "I need to respond to this survey as a primary or secondary school teacher from Brazil regarding AI in education. Let me go through each statement and provide thoughtful responses based on a realistic teacher's perspective.\n\nLet me think about each statement:\n\n[TT4G35A]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\n- This is a benefit statement. AI tools can help with lesson planning. I would say \"Agree\" - this is a reasonable use case for AI in education.\n\n[TT4G35B]: Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- This is a benefit statement about personalization. AI can help with adaptive learning. I would say \"Agree\" - this is a known capability of AI systems.\n\n[TT4G35C]: Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\n- This is a benefit statement about individual support. AI could provide personalized feedback and support. I would say \"Agree\" - this is feasible.\n\n[TT4G35D]: Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- This is a benefit statement about supporting diverse learners. AI can provide language support and adapted content. I would say \"Strongly agree\" - this is a strong use case for AI.\n\n[TT4G35E]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- This is a benefit statement about administrative efficiency. AI can help with grading, attendance, scheduling, etc. I would say \"Agree\" - this is definitely a capability.\n\n[TT4G35F]: Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a risk statement about academic dishonesty. AI tools like ChatGPT can be used to plagiarize. As a teacher, I would be concerned about this. I would say \"Strongly agree\" - this is a real concern.\n\n[TT4G35G]: Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n\n\n- AI systems have reliability issues and can produce inaccurate or unsuitable suggestions. I would say \"Agree\" - this is a documented limitation.\n\n[TT4G35H]: Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\n- AI can perpetuate biases embedded in training data, which is a significant concern. I would say \"Agree\" - this is a known problem with AI systems.\n\n[TT4G35I]: Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\n- Data protection is a major concern when implementing AI in schools. I would say \"Strongly agree\" - this is a critical issue.\n\n[TT4G35J]: Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\n- AI might recommend teaching methods that lack evidence-based support or don't fit the specific context. I would say \"Agree\" - this is a legitimate risk worth considering.\n\nI'm trying to be balanced here—acknowledging that these are real concerns while recognizing that AI does have potential benefits in education. As a teacher, I need to be cautious about these limitations and use AI thoughtfully rather than uncritically."
