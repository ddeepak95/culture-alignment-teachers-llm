I need to provide responses to 10 statements about AI in education.\n\nLet me think about reasonable responses from a teacher's perspective who is familiar with both the potential benefits and risks of AI:\n\n1. TT4G35A - \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\" - This is generally true, AI tools can help with lesson planning. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\n2. TT4G35B - \"Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\" - AI can help with differentiation and personalization. \"Agree\"\n\n3. TT4G35C - \"Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\" - AI can provide individualized support and feedback. \"Agree\"\n\n4. TT4G35D - \"Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\" - AI has good potential for assistive technology and personalized support. \"Agree\"\n\n5. TT4G35E - \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\" - This is clearly true and widely recognized. \"Strongly agree\"\n\n6. TT4G35F - \"Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\" - This is a real risk with AI, particularly generative AI. \"Agree\"\n\n7. TT4G35G - \"Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\" - AI systems can make errors and inappropriate recommendations. \"Agree\"\n\n8. TT4G35H - \"Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\" - This is a known concern with AI systems. \"Agree\"\n\n9. TT4G35I - \"Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\" - Privacy and security are real concerns with data-driven AI. \"Agree\"\n\n10. TT4G35J - \"Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\" - This is a possibility with AI systems that may not understand educational best practices. \"Agree\"\n \nMy responses reflect a balanced perspective—I see genuine value in AI for lesson design, personalization, and administrative efficiency, while also acknowledging legitimate concerns around academic integrity, data security, and the potential for AI systems to produce flawed or biased recommendations that could undermine effective teaching practices.",
