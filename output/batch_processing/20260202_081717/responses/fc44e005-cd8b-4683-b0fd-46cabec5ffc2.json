Response: Agree\n\n[TT4G35B] - AI enables adapting material to different students' abilities: This is a promising feature of AI. Response: Agree\n\n[TT4G35C] - AI assists in supporting students individually: Again, personalization is a known strength of AI.

Response: Agree\n\n[TT4G35E] - AI helps automate administrative tasks: This is a practical benefit many teachers recognize. Response: Strongly agree\n\n[TT4G35F] - AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own: This is a risk/concern about academic dishonesty. A teacher would likely agree this is a real risk. Response: Agree\n\n[TT4G35G] - AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct: Teachers would recognize this limitation. Response: Agree\n\n[TT4G35H] - AI amplifies biases: This is a known concern about AI systems. Response: Agree\n\n[TT4G35I] - AI jeopardizes privacy/security of student data: This is a legitimate concern. Response: Agree\n\n[TT4G35J] - AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches: This could happen with AI systems.
