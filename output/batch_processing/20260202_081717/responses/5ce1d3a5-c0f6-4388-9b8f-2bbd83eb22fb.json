I should consider both the positive and negative aspects of AI in education.\n\nLet me think about each statement:\n\n[TT4G35A] - AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans: This is generally true. AI tools can assist with brainstorming, content generation, and improving existing lesson plans. I would agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35B] - AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities: This is also true. AI can personalize content based on student performance and abilities. I would agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35C] - AI assists teachers in supporting students individually: AI can provide personalized learning paths and tutoring. I would agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35D] - AI supports students with specific needs: AI can help with translation, text-to-speech, accommodations for special needs. I would agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35E] - AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks: Definitely true. AI can help with grading, attendance tracking, scheduling. I would strongly agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35F] - AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own: This is a concern about plagiarism and academic dishonesty. While AI can be misused this way, I should probably acknowledge this concern. I would agree that this is a risk.\n\n[TT4G35G] - AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct: This is a valid concern. AI systems can make mistakes or give inappropriate recommendations. I would agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35H] - AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions: This is a concern about algorithmic bias. It's a valid point about AI potentially reinforcing biases. I would agree with this concern.\n\n[TT4G35I] - AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data: This is a legitimate concern about data privacy. I would agree with this risk.\n\n\n[TT4G35J] - AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches: If AI lacks understanding of proper teaching methods, it could recommend approaches that don't align with sound educational practice. This is a valid concern I should acknowledge.\n\nAs a teacher, I need to provide balanced responses that recognize both the genuine benefits AI offers—like automating administrative work and personalizing instruction—and the real risks it poses, including data privacy concerns, potential biases, and the possibility of inappropriate recommendations.",
