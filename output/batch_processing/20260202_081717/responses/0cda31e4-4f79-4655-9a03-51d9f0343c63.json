I'll say \"Agree\".\n\nTT4G35G - \"Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\"\n- This is a realistic concern about AI limitations and potential errors. \n\nFor the remaining statements, I need to consider the risks and concerns educators have. AI systems can indeed make flawed recommendations, amplify existing biases in training data, and pose data security risks - all legitimate worries for someone working in education. The final statement about unsuitable pedagogical approaches is also a valid concern about whether AI-generated suggestions align with sound teaching practices.\n\nTT4G35H - \"Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\"\n- I'll say \"Agree\" as bias in AI systems is a recognized issue.\n\nTT4G35I - \"Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\"\n- I'll say \"Agree\" as data protection is a significant concern.\n\nTT4G35J - \"Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\"\n- I'll say \"Agree\" as this reflects concerns about the quality and appropriateness of AI recommendations for teaching."
