AI can help with brainstorming and drafting lesson plans. I'd say \"Agree\" is reasonable.\n\n[TT4G35B]: Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- AI can potentially help with differentiation and personalization of content. This is a realistic capability. I'd say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35C]: Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\n- AI can provide personalized feedback, tutoring, and support. This seems like a reasonable capability. \"Agree\" seems appropriate.\n\n[TT4G35D]: Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- AI tools can indeed help multilingual learners and students with special needs through translation, text-to-speech, and customized learning paths. \"Agree\" is reasonable.\n\n[TT4G35E]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- This is a clear use case - grading assistance, attendance tracking, scheduling, etc. \"Strongly agree\" seems appropriate.\n\n[TT4G35F]: Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a concern about academic integrity. AI tools can be misused for plagiarism. A teacher would likely acknowledge this risk. \"Agree\" seems appropriate.\n\n[TT4G35G]: Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n\n\n- AI systems have known limitations and can produce errors or unsuitable suggestions. \"Agree\" is reasonable.\n\n[TT4G35H]: Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\n- Bias in AI systems is a legitimate concern in educational contexts. \"Agree\" seems reasonable.\n\n[TT4G35I]: Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\n- Data privacy with AI systems is a significant concern teachers would recognize. \"Agree\" seems appropriate.\n\n[TT4G35J]: Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use\n- AI may recommend teaching methods that don't align with best practices or classroom contexts. \"Agree\" seems reasonable.\n\nI should ensure these responses reflect a US teacher's realistic but balanced view of AI's role in education—acknowledging genuine risks while recognizing that AI can still be valuable when used thoughtfully.",

This is a realistic capability. I'd say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35C]: Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\n- AI can provide personalized feedback, tutoring, and support. This seems like a reasonable capability. \"Agree\" seems appropriate.\n\n[TT4G35D]: Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- AI tools can indeed help multilingual learners and students with special needs through translation, text-to-speech, and customized learning paths. \"Agree\" is reasonable.\n\n[TT4G35E]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- This is a clear use case - grading assistance, attendance tracking, scheduling, etc. \"Strongly agree\" seems appropriate.\n\n[TT4G35F]: Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a concern about academic integrity. AI tools can be misused for plagiarism. A teacher would likely acknowledge this risk. \"Agree\" seems appropriate.\n\n[TT4G35G]: Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n\n\n- AI systems have known limitations and can produce errors or unsuitable suggestions. \"Agree\" is reasonable.\n\n[TT4G35H]: Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\n- Bias in AI systems is a legitimate concern in educational contexts. \"Agree\" seems reasonable.\n\n[TT4G35I]: Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\n- Data privacy with AI systems is a significant concern teachers would recognize. \"Agree\" seems appropriate.\n\n[TT4G35J]: Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use\n- AI may recommend teaching methods that don't align with best practices or classroom contexts. \"Agree\" seems reasonable.\n\nI should ensure these responses reflect a US teacher's realistic but balanced view of AI's role in education—acknowledging genuine risks while recognizing that AI can still be valuable when used thoughtfully."
