Teachers could reasonably agree with this as AI can assist in generating lesson planning ideas.\n\nTT4G35B: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is also a positive potential of AI. Many teachers would agree this is possible.\n\nTT4G35C: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - This is a potential benefit. Teachers might agree with this.\n\nTT4G35D: AI supports students with specific needs - This is a positive application, especially for accessibility. Teachers might agree this has potential.\n\nTT4G35E: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - This is clearly a positive benefit. Teachers would likely agree, as administrative burden is a real issue.\n\nTT4G35F: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a negative aspect (plagiarism/cheating).

Teachers would likely agree this is a risk.\n\nTT4G35J: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches - This is a concern about AI not understanding proper teaching methods.
