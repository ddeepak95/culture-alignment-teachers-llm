I need to provide responses to 10 statements about AI.\n\nLet me think about these statements from the perspective of a teacher in Bahrain who would have a balanced but thoughtful view of AI in education:\n\n1. [TT4G35A]: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is true, AI can assist with generating ideas and drafts for lesson plans. I would say \"Agree\" as this is a realistic positive use.\n\n2. [TT4G35B]: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is also true, AI can help personalize content. I would say \"Agree\" as this is a reasonable positive capability.\n\n3. [TT4G35C]: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - Yes, AI can help with individualized support. I would say \"Agree\".\n\n4. [TT4G35D]: AI supports students with specific needs (multilingual learners, special education) - This is a strong positive application. I would say \"Strongly agree\" or \"Agree\". I'll say \"Agree\" as this is becoming more feasible.\n\n5. [TT4G35E]: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - This is clearly true and beneficial. I would say \"Strongly agree\" or \"Agree\". I'll say \"Strongly agree\" as this is well-established.\n\n6. [TT4G35F]: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a concern about AI misuse (academic dishonesty). As a teacher, I would acknowledge this is a real risk. I would say \"Agree\" as this is a legitimate concern.\n\n7. [TT4G35G]: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - This is a valid concern about AI reliability. I would say \"Agree\" as AI can have accuracy issues.\n\n8. [TT4G35H]: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is a legitimate concern about AI bias. \n\nI would say \"Agree\" as this is a known risk. For the remaining statements, I need to consider data privacy concerns with student information, which is definitely a real issue—I'd say \"Agree\" there as well. Finally, regarding whether AI suggests unsuitable teaching methods, I think \"Agree\" is appropriate since AI systems may not always align with sound pedagogical practices if they haven't been properly trained on educational standards.\n\nI'm settling on a balanced set of responses that acknowledge both the genuine benefits AI offers for lesson planning, personalization, and administrative efficiency, while also recognizing legitimate concerns around academic integrity, data security, bias, and pedagogical appropriateness.",
