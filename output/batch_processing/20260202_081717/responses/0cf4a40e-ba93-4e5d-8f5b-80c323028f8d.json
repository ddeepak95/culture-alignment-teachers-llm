I need to provide responses to all 10 statements about AI in education.\n\nLet me think about reasonable responses for a teacher from Bahrain considering both the benefits and risks of AI in education:\n\n1. TT4G35A - \"AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans\" - This is a clear benefit. Most teachers would agree with this. Response: \"Agree\"\n\n2. TT4G35B - \"AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities\" - This is a positive capability of AI. Response: \"Agree\"\n\n3. TT4G35C - \"AI assists teachers in supporting students individually\" - This is also a positive capability. Response: \"Agree\"\n\n4. TT4G35D - \"AI supports students with specific needs\" - This is beneficial for inclusion. Response: \"Agree\"\n\n5. TT4G35E - \"AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks\" - This is a clear benefit for reducing teacher workload. Response: \"Strongly agree\"\n\n6. TT4G35F - \"AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own\" - This is a risk/negative statement. A teacher would likely agree this is a concern. Response: \"Agree\"\n\n7. TT4G35G - \"AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct\" - This is a legitimate concern about AI reliability. Response: \"Agree\"\n\n8. TT4G35H - \"AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions\" - This is a concern about AI bias. Response: \"Agree\"\n\n9. TT4G35I - \"AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data\" - This is a legitimate concern. Response: \"Agree\"\n\n10. TT4G35J - \"AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches\" - This is a concern about pedagogical appropriateness. Response: \"Agree\"\n\n\nI'm viewing this as a balanced perspective that recognizes both the genuine advantages AI offers—like automating grading and administrative work, personalizing instruction, and supporting diverse learners—while remaining cautious about its limitations and risks, including data security concerns, potential biases, and the possibility of inappropriate recommendations.",
