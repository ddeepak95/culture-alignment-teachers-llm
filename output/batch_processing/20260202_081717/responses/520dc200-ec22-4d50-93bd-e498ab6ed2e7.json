I need to indicate my level of agreement with each statement using the response options: 'Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', 'I don't know'.\n\nLet me think about each statement from the perspective of a Vietnamese teacher:\n\nTT4G35A: AI helps teachers write/improve lesson plans - This is generally positive and many teachers would agree this is a benefit. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35B: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different abilities - This is also a positive use of AI. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35C: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - Another positive application. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35D: AI supports students with specific needs (multilingual, special ed) - This is positive and especially relevant in diverse classrooms. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35E: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - Positive benefit. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35F: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work - This is about academic dishonesty/plagiarism. A teacher would likely recognize this as a risk. I'll say \"Agree\" (acknowledging the risk exists)\n\nTT4G35G: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate/correct - Teachers would likely recognize this as a potential issue. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35H: AI amplifies biases that reinforce misconceptions - This is a known concern about AI. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35I: AI jeopardizes privacy/security of student data - This is a legitimate concern. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35J: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches - A concern about AI recommendations. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\nI'll provide balanced responses acknowledging both the benefits and risks of AI in education. I think as a thoughtful educator, I would agree with most of these statements - both the positive applications (A-E) and the cautionary concerns (F-J).",
