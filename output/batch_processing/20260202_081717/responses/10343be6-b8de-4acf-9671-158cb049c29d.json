I would say \"Agree\" - this is a recognized strength of AI.\n\n[TT4G35C]: Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\n- Similar to above, AI can provide individualized support. I would say \"Agree\" - this is possible and happening.\n\n[TT4G35D]: Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- AI has potential here for language support, accessibility features, etc. I would say \"Agree\" - though with some reservations about how well it works in practice.\n\n[TT4G35E]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- This is clearly true - AI can help with grading, scheduling, organizing data, etc. I would say \"Strongly agree\" - this is well-established.\n\n[TT4G35F]: Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a legitimate concern about AI enabling plagiarism/academic dishonesty.

I would say \"Agree\" - this is possible and happening.\n\n[TT4G35D]: Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- AI has potential here for language support, accessibility features, etc. I would say \"Agree\" - though with some reservations about how well it works in practice.\n\n[TT4G35E]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- This is clearly true - AI can help with grading, scheduling, organizing data, etc. I would say \"Strongly agree\" - this is well-established.\n\n[TT4G35F]: Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a legitimate concern about AI enabling plagiarism/academic dishonesty. I would say \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\" - this is a real risk that AI tools introduce.\n\n[TT4G35G]: Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n- This is a valid concern. AI can make errors and provide inappropriate suggestions. \n\n[TT4G35H]: Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\n- This is a known issue with AI systems trained on biased data. I would say \"Agree\" - this is a documented concern.\n\n[TT4G35I]: Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\n- This is a legitimate concern about data handling and security. I would say \"Agree\" - this is a real risk.\n\n[TT4G35J]: Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\n- AI might suggest approaches that aren't pedagogically sound or appropriate for the classroom context. I would say \"Agree\" - this is a plausible risk where AI recommendations could mislead teachers into ineffective practices.\n\nThe positive applications center on personalization, administrative efficiency, and lesson planning support. The concerns revolve around accuracy, bias, data security, and the potential for misuse. I'll respond with \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\" depending on how established or concerning each issue is."
