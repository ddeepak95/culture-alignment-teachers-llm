Let me think about each statement carefully:\n\n[TT4G35A]: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is a realistic benefit. I should agree with this as AI can indeed assist with lesson planning.\n\n[TT4G35B]: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is also a realistic benefit. AI can help personalize content for different learning levels.\n\n[TT4G35C]: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - This is another benefit. AI can help with individual student support through personalized learning paths.\n\n[TT4G35D]: AI supports students with specific needs (multilingual learners, special education needs) - This is a positive application of AI that can be beneficial.\n\n[TT4G35E]: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - This is definitely true and a major benefit for reducing teacher workload.\n\n[TT4G35F]: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a risk/concern. Students could use AI-generated content and pass it off as their own. As a teacher, I would recognize this is a valid concern and should agree.\n\n[TT4G35G]: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - This is a valid concern. AI can make errors. A reasonable position would be to agree as this is a known limitation.\n\n[TT4G35H]: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is a concern about algorithmic bias. As an aware teacher, I would likely agree this is a potential risk.\n\n[TT4G35I]: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data - This is a legitimate concern about data protection. I should agree with this as it's a real issue in education technology.\n\n[TT4G35J]: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students - This is a valid concern. AI may not always suggest pedagogically sound approaches. I should agree this is possible.\n\n\nA balanced perspective recognizes both the genuine advantages AI offers—from streamlining lesson design to personalizing instruction for diverse learners—and the real challenges it presents, including academic integrity issues, potential inaccuracies, algorithmic bias, data security risks, and pedagogically questionable recommendations. I'll express agreement with the benefits while also acknowledging these legitimate concerns as a thoughtful educator would.",
