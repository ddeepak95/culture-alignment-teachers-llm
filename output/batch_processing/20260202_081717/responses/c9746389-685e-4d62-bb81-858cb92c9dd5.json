Let me consider each one carefully:\n\n[TT4G35A]: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is a positive use case. AI tools can help with drafting and refining lesson plans. I would agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35B]: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is also a positive capability of AI. Adaptive learning systems can help personalize content. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35C]: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - Another positive application for personalized support. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35D]: AI supports students with specific needs (multilingual learners, SEN) - This is a valuable benefit, especially in Morocco where multilingual education is important. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35E]: AI helps automate administrative tasks - This is realistic and positive. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35F]: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a negative consequence (plagiarism risk). This is true - AI tools like ChatGPT can facilitate academic dishonesty. I would agree with this concern.\n\n[TT4G35G]: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - This is a valid concern about accuracy and reliability. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35H]: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is a legitimate concern about AI bias. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35I]: AI jeopardizes privacy and security of student data - This is a valid concern, especially given concerns about data protection. I would agree with this concern.\n\n[TT4G35J]: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches - This is a concern about inappropriate teaching methods being suggested. I would agree this is a concern.\n\nAs a Moroccan teacher, I would have a balanced view - seeing both benefits and concerns about AI. I'll aim for realistic responses that acknowledge both opportunities and risks.",
