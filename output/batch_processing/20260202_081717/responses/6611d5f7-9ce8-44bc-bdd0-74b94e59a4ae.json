I need to respond to each of the 10 statements with one of the response options: 'Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', or 'I don't know'.\n\nLet me think about reasonable responses from a teacher's perspective:\n\n[TT4G35A] - AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans: This is a reasonable statement. Teachers would likely agree that AI can help with lesson planning. I'll say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35B] - AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities: This is also reasonable - AI can help with differentiation. I'll say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35C] - AI assists teachers in supporting students individually: This is a positive use case. I'll say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35D] - AI supports students with specific needs: This is about accessibility and inclusion. I'll say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35E] - AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks: This is a well-known benefit. I'll say \"Strongly agree\".\n\n[TT4G35F] - AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own: This is a concern/risk. A teacher would likely agree this is a concern. I'll say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35G] - AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct: This is a valid concern. I'll say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35H] - AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions: This is a known concern about AI. I'll say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35I] - AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data: This is a legitimate concern. I'll say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35J] - AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students: This is a concern. \n\nFor this last one, I think \"Disagree\" is more appropriate—while AI could occasionally suggest questionable methods, it's not something I'd consider a widespread problem that regularly impacts my teaching practice.\n\nNow I need to format these responses for the function call with the exact statement text, question IDs, and responses.",
