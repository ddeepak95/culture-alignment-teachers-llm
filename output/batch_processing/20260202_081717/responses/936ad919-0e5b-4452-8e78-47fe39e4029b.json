I need to provide responses to each of 10 statements about AI's benefits and risks in education.\n\nLet me think about reasonable responses from the perspective of a Bulgarian teacher:\n\n[TT4G35A]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\n- This is a genuine capability of AI, particularly with tools like ChatGPT. I would \"Agree\" with this.\n\n[TT4G35B]: Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- AI can certainly help with personalization and differentiation. I would \"Agree\" with this.\n\n[TT4G35C]: Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\n- AI tools can provide individualized support through tutoring, feedback, etc. I would \"Agree\" with this.\n\n[TT4G35D]: Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- AI has potential for this through text-to-speech, translation, adaptive learning, etc. I would \"Agree\" with this.\n\n[TT4G35E]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- AI can definitely help with grading, attendance, scheduling, etc. I would \"Strongly agree\" with this, as this is a clear benefit.\n\n[TT4G35F]: Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a legitimate concern with AI tools like ChatGPT being used for plagiarism. I would \"Agree\" with this concern.\n\n[TT4G35G]: Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n- AI systems do have issues with accuracy and appropriateness. I would \"Agree\" with this concern.\n\n[TT4G35H]: Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\n\n\n- AI trained on biased data can perpetuate problematic patterns. I would \"Agree\" with this concern.\n\n[TT4G35I]: Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\n- Data protection is a serious issue when using AI systems in schools. I would \"Agree\" with this concern.\n\n[TT4G35J]: Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\n- While AI might not always align with sound teaching practices, I'm uncertain whether it would actively recommend harmful methods. I would \"Disagree\" because I don't think this is a primary risk, though I have reservations about AI's pedagogical understanding.\n\nActually, reconsidering this—if AI isn't properly trained on educational best practices, it could suggest ineffective or inappropriate teaching strategies. I'll shift to \"Agree\" to acknowledge this genuine risk. I want to balance recognizing both the potential benefits and real concerns around AI in educational settings."
