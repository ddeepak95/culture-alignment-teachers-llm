I need to provide my level of agreement with each statement using the response options: 'Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', 'I don't know'.\n\nLet me think about reasonable responses from the perspective of a Vietnamese school teacher:\n\nTT4G35A: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is a positive application. I would agree with this.\n\nTT4G35B: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is a positive capability. I would agree.\n\nTT4G35C: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - This is a positive capability.

I would agree.\n\nTT4G35F: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a negative/concern statement about misuse. I would agree this is a risk.\n\nTT4G35G: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - This is a concern about AI reliability.

I would agree this could be an issue.\n\nTT4G35I: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data - This is a concern about privacy. I would agree this is a potential risk.\n\nTT4G35J: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches - This is a concern about appropriateness. I would agree this could be an issue.\n\nAs a realistic teacher perspective, I would likely:\n- Agree with the positive applications (A-E)\n- Agree with the concerns (F-J), since these are valid concerns\n\n\n- Structure my responses to reflect both the benefits I see in classroom practice and the legitimate risks I'm aware of.",
