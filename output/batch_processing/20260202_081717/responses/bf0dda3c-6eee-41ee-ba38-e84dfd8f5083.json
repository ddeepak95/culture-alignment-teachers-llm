AI tools can be used for plagiarism. A teacher would likely agree this is a concern. I'd say \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\". Let me say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35G]: \"Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\" - This is a risk statement about accuracy. \n\nAI systems can produce inaccurate or unsuitable suggestions, which is a realistic concern for educators. I'd say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35H]: \"Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\" - Bias in AI systems is a legitimate concern that could reinforce problematic patterns. I'd say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35I]: \"Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\" - Data privacy and security risks with AI systems are genuine concerns that teachers would be aware of. I'd say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35J]: \"Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\" - This is about whether AI might recommend teaching methods that aren't appropriate for the classroom context.\n\nAI could plausibly make poor pedagogical recommendations, so I'd say \"Agree\" as this is a reasonable concern."
