I need to provide responses to 10 statements about artificial intelligence in education.\n\nLet me think about how a teacher from Belgium might reasonably respond to these statements. The statements cover both positive aspects of AI (A-E) and concerns/risks (F-J).\n\nFor the positive statements:\n- TT4G35A: AI helps with lesson planning - This is a reasonable positive use case. A teacher would likely agree with this.\n- TT4G35B: AI enables adaptation to different student abilities - This is also a reasonable positive use case. Teachers would likely see potential here.\n- TT4G35C: AI assists in individual student support - This is a positive use case. Teachers would likely agree.\n- TT4G35D: AI supports students with specific needs - This is a positive use case, particularly for inclusive education which is important in Belgium.\n- TT4G35E: AI helps automate administrative tasks - Teachers generally appreciate this. This would likely get agreement.\n\nFor the concern/risk statements:\n- TT4G35F: Students misrepresenting work - This is a real concern with AI and academic integrity. Teachers would likely agree with this concern.\n- TT4G35G: AI makes inappropriate recommendations - This is a valid concern. Teachers would likely agree.\n- TT4G35H: AI amplifies biases - This is a concern many educators have. Teachers would likely agree.\n- TT4G35I: Privacy and security of student data - This is a significant concern. Teachers would likely agree.\n- TT4G35J: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches - This is a concern some teachers might have. Teachers would likely agree to some extent.\n\nAs a Belgian teacher responding honestly to a survey, I would likely:\n- Agree or strongly agree with the positive statements (A-E)\n- Agree or strongly agree with the risk/concern statements (F-J)\n\n\n- Provide balanced responses that acknowledge both the genuine benefits AI offers for lesson preparation and personalized learning, while taking seriously the legitimate risks around academic dishonesty, data protection, and algorithmic bias.
