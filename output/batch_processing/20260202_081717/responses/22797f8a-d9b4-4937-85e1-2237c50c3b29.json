I need to provide thoughtful responses to each statement based on realistic perspectives a teacher might have.\n\nLet me consider each statement:\n\nTT4G35A: AI helps teachers write/improve lesson plans - This is generally a positive use. I would \"Agree\" as this is a reasonable and well-documented benefit.\n\nTT4G35B: AI enables adaptation to different students' abilities - This is also a positive benefit. I would \"Agree\" as AI can help personalize learning.\n\nTT4G35C: AI assists in supporting students individually - This is another positive use. I would \"Agree\".\n\nTT4G35D: AI supports students with specific needs - This is beneficial for accessibility. I would \"Agree\".\n\nTT4G35E: AI helps automate administrative tasks - This is clearly beneficial for teachers. I would \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\".\n\nTT4G35F: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work - This is a negative concern. I would \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\" since this is a real concern.\n\nTT4G35G: AI makes inappropriate or incorrect recommendations - This is a valid concern.

I would \"Agree\".\n\nTT4G35J: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches - This is a concern. I would \"Agree\" or \"Disagree\" depending on whether we think AI systems are generally appropriate.\n\nAs a teacher responding realistically, I would likely have balanced views - acknowledging both benefits and concerns.
