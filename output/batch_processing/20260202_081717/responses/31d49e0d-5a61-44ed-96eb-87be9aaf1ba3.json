[TT4G35A] - AI helps teachers write/improve lesson plans: This is a reasonable benefit of AI. I'd say \"Agree\" - AI tools can certainly help with this.\n\n2. [TT4G35B] - AI enables teachers to adapt material to different students' abilities: This is plausible with AI personalization features. I'd say \"Agree\" - this is a known capability of adaptive learning systems.\n\n3. [TT4G35C] - AI assists in supporting students individually: Similar to B, AI can provide individualized support. I'd say \"Agree\".\n\n4. [TT4G35D] - AI supports students with specific needs (multilingual, SEN): AI can help with translation and personalization for special needs. I'd say \"Agree\" - this is an important application.\n\n5. [TT4G35E] - AI helps automate administrative tasks: This is clearly true - scheduling, grading assistance, etc. I'd say \"Strongly agree\" - this is a well-established benefit.\n\n6. [TT4G35F] - AI enables students to misrepresent others' work: This is a negative/risk statement. AI tools like ChatGPT can certainly be misused for plagiarism. I'd say \"Agree\" - this is a real concern.\n\n7. [TT4G35G] - AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct: This is a legitimate concern about AI limitations. I'd say \"Agree\" - AI can make mistakes.\n\n8. [TT4G35H] - AI amplifies biases that reinforce misconceptions: This is a known issue with AI systems. \n\nAI systems can perpetuate existing biases, which is a genuine risk in educational contexts. I'd say \"Agree\".\n\n9. [TT4G35I] - AI jeopardises privacy and security of student data: Data protection is a significant concern, particularly given GDPR requirements in Hungary. I'd say \"Agree\".\n\n10. [TT4G35J] - AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches: Poorly designed AI systems could recommend teaching methods that don't fit educational best practices.
