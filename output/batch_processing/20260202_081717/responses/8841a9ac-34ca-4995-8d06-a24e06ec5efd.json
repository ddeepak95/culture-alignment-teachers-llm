A teacher would likely agree with this as it's a practical application. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\nB. \"AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities\" - This is also a positive benefit. Teachers would likely recognize this potential.

Teachers would likely be aware of this risk. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\nI. \"AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data\" - This is a serious concern teachers would have.
