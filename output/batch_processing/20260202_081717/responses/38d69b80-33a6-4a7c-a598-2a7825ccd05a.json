I would say \"Agree\".\n\nTT4G35I - \"Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\" - Data protection is a legitimate concern when implementing AI in schools. I would say \"Agree\".\n\nTT4G35J - \"Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\" - AI systems might recommend teaching methods that don't align with sound educational practice. I would say \"Agree\" as this remains a reasonable concern.\n\nI need to approach the remaining statements with nuance, acknowledging both the potential advantages and real limitations of AI in Vietnamese educational contexts. A balanced perspective means recognizing where AI can genuinely support teaching while remaining cautious about its drawbacks."
