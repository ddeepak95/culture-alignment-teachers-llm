Many teachers would likely agree that AI can assist with this. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35B]: \"Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\" - This is a potential benefit of AI, though implementation varies. \"Agree\" seems reasonable.\n\n[TT4G35C]: \"Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\" - Similar to above, this is a potential benefit. \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35D]: \"Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\" - AI can help with this, though it's still developing. \"Agree\" seems fair.\n\n[TT4G35E]: \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\" - This is clearly a capability of AI. \"Strongly agree\" or \"Agree\" - I'll go with \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35F]: \"Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\" - This is a real concern with AI.

I'll say \"Agree\"\n\nI should provide balanced responses that acknowledge both the genuine advantages AI offers for instruction and assessment, as well as the real risks around data security, bias, and pedagogical appropriateness that educators need to consider carefully.",
