Let me think about reasonable responses for each statement:\n\n[TT4G35A]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\n- This is a positive use case. AI can indeed help with lesson planning. I would say \"Agree\" - this is a practical benefit.\n\n[TT4G35B]: Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- This is also a positive capability of AI. Personalized learning is a key advantage. I would say \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\". Let me go with \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35C]: Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\n- Similar to above, this is a positive use. Individual support is enhanced by AI. I would say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35D]: Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- This is also a positive capability.

AI can help with grading, attendance, etc. I would say \"Strongly agree\" - this is an obvious benefit.\n\n[TT4G35F]: Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a negative/risk statement about academic integrity. AI tools like ChatGPT can indeed be used for plagiarism. As a teacher, I would likely \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\" with this concern. Let me say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35G]: Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n- This is a valid concern about AI accuracy and appropriateness.
