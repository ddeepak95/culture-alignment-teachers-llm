I need to provide a response for each of the 10 statements using one of these options: 'Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', 'I don't know'.\n\nLet me think about reasonable responses from the perspective of a typical teacher who has some experience with or awareness of AI in education:\n\nTT4G35A - AI helps write/improve lesson plans: This is generally true - many teachers do use AI for this. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35B - AI enables adapting material to different students' abilities: This is a capability AI can provide through personalized learning. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35C - AI assists in supporting students individually: This is true - AI can provide personalized support. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35D - AI supports students with specific needs: This is possible and true for many cases (multilingual, special needs). I'd say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35E - AI helps automate administrative tasks: This is definitely true. I'd say \"Strongly agree\"\n\nTT4G35F - AI enables students to misrepresent others' work: This is a real concern - this is a negative aspect. I'd say \"Agree\" (acknowledging this is a real problem)\n\nTT4G35G - AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct: This is true - AI can make errors. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35H - AI amplifies biases: This is a known concern with AI. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35I - AI jeopardises privacy/security: This is a valid concern. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35J - AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches: This could happen, though it's less certain. I'd say \"Disagree\" or \"I don't know\" - I'll go with \"Disagree\" as teachers would typically review and filter recommendations.\n\n\nI should reconsider my responses to strike a better balance between recognizing AI's genuine benefits while remaining realistic about its limitations and risks. A thoughtful educator would acknowledge both the potential and the concerns without being overly optimistic or pessimistic about the technology's role in the classroom.",
