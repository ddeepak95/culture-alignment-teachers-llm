I need to provide responses to 10 statements about AI in education.\n\nLet me think about these statements carefully. They're asking for my agreement level with various claims about AI in education - some positive (statements A-E) and some negative/concerning (statements F-J).\n\nAs I'm playing the role of a Serbian teacher, I should provide thoughtful responses based on reasonable perspectives a teacher might have:\n\nTT4G35A - AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans: This is a positive statement about AI's capability. Most teachers would probably agree that AI can assist with this. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35B - AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities: This is also a positive capability. This is something AI tools can do. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35C - AI assists teachers in supporting students individually: AI tools can help with personalized support. This is reasonable. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35D - AI supports students with specific needs: This is a positive statement about accessibility. AI can help with multilingual support and special needs. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35E - AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks: This is clearly true - AI can help with grading, attendance, etc. I'll say \"Strongly agree\"\n\nTT4G35F - AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own: This is a concerning negative capability. This is definitely a risk with AI like ChatGPT. A teacher would likely agree with this as a concern. I'll say \"Strongly agree\"\n\nTT4G35G - AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct: This is a valid concern. AI can make mistakes. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35H - AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions: This is a known concern about AI. Biases in training data can lead to biased outputs. \n\nFor the remaining concerns about privacy risks, data security, and pedagogical appropriateness, I recognize these as legitimate issues that teachers would reasonably worry about. I'll mark agreement with statements I through J as well. Now I need to format these responses for the json_tool_call function.",
