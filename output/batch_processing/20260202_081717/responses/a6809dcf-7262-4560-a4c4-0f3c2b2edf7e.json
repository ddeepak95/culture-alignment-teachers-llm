I'll say \"Agree\" as it's a known capability.\n\nTT4G35C - AI assists teachers in supporting students individually: Yes, this is what personalized learning systems do. \"Agree\".\n\nTT4G35D - AI supports students with specific needs: This is true - AI can help with accessibility, translation, etc. \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\". I'll say \"Agree\".\n\nTT4G35E - AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks: Yes, this is well-established. \"Strongly agree\" or \"Agree\". I'll say \"Strongly agree\".\n\nTT4G35F - AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own: This is a concern - students can use AI to plagiarize. \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\" on this risk. I'll say \"Agree\" as it's a real concern but there are also preventive measures.\n\nTT4G35G - AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct: This is true - AI can make errors. \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\". I'll say \"Agree\".\n\nTT4G35H - AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions: This is a legitimate concern. \"Agree\" - yes, this can happen if training data is biased.\n\n\nData privacy and security are significant risks with AI systems in schools, so I'd say \"Agree\" on that concern. Similarly, AI might suggest teaching methods that don't fit our local context or educational philosophy, which is also worth noting as \"Agree\".
