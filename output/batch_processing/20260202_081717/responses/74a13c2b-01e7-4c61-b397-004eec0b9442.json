I need to provide responses to 10 statements about AI in education.\n\nLet me think about what would be reasonable responses from a teacher's perspective:\n\nTT4G35A - AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans: This is a positive application. I'd say \"Agree\" - AI tools like ChatGPT can help generate ideas for lesson plans.\n\nTT4G35B - AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities: This is also positive. AI can help personalize learning. I'd say \"Agree\".\n\nTT4G35C - AI assists teachers in supporting students individually: This is a positive use case. I'd say \"Agree\".\n\nTT4G35D - AI supports students with specific needs: This is positive and particularly relevant for accessibility. I'd say \"Agree\".\n\nTT4G35E - AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks: This is a well-known benefit. I'd say \"Strongly agree\" - teachers spend a lot of time on admin tasks.\n\nTT4G35F - AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own: This is a concern/negative aspect. I'd say \"Strongly agree\" - this is a real concern with AI.\n\nTT4G35G - AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct: This is a legitimate concern. I'd say \"Agree\" - AI can make mistakes or give incorrect information.\n\nTT4G35H - AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions: This is a concern. I'd say \"Agree\" - this is a known issue with AI systems.\n\nTT4G35I - AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data: This is a significant concern. I'd say \"Agree\" - data privacy is a major issue with AI systems.\n\nTT4G35J - AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches: This is a concern. I'd say \"Agree\" - AI might not always suggest pedagogically sound approaches.\n\n\nI should present a nuanced perspective that acknowledges both the genuine advantages AI offers for teaching and learning, while also recognizing the legitimate risks and challenges that come with its implementation in educational settings.",
