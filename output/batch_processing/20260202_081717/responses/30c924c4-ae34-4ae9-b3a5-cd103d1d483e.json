        "reasoning_content": "The user is asking me to respond to a survey about AI in education as if I were a primary or secondary school teacher from New Zealand. I need to respond to 10 statements with one of the response options: 'Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', or 'I don't know'.\n\nLet me think about each statement from the perspective of a thoughtful educator:\n\nTT4G35A: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is generally true. AI tools like ChatGPT can help brainstorm ideas and structure lesson plans. I would \"Agree\" with this.\n\nTT4G35B: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is a capability that AI can have (adaptive learning systems, differentiation tools), though it depends on implementation. I would \"Agree\" with this.\n\nTT4G35C: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - Yes, AI can provide personalized feedback, tutoring, etc. I would \"Agree\".\n\nTT4G35D: AI supports students with specific needs - AI can have tools for accessibility, translation, etc. I would \"Agree\" with this potential.\n\nTT4G35E: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - Absolutely, things like grading, organizing records, etc. I would \"Strongly agree\" with this.\n\nTT4G35F: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a concern. AI can be used for academic dishonesty (plagiarism, cheating). I would \"Agree\" that this is a potential risk.\n\nTT4G35G: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - Yes, AI systems can make errors and inappropriate recommendations. I would \"Agree\" with this.\n\nTT4G35H: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is a known issue with AI systems that are trained on biased data. I would \"Agree\" with this concern.\n\n\nThe final two statements concern me as well. Data privacy is a genuine risk when using AI systems in schools, particularly around how student information is collected and stored. Similarly, teachers might uncritically adopt pedagogical suggestions from AI without considering whether they're actually suitable for their particular classroom context. Both of these are realistic concerns I'd \"Agree\" with.",
