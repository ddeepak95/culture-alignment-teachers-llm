Most teachers would likely agree that AI can assist with this task. Response: Agree\n\n[TT4G35B]: Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- This is also a positive potential application of AI for differentiation.

Response: Agree\n\n[TT4G35D]: Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- AI can be very helpful for accessibility and supporting diverse learners. Response: Agree\n\n[TT4G35E]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- This is clearly a useful application of AI.

Teachers would likely agree this is a real concern. Response: Agree\n\n[TT4G35G]: Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n- This is a valid concern about AI reliability.
