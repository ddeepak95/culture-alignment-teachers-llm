I need to provide thoughtful responses based on a balanced perspective of AI in education. Let me consider each statement:\n\n[TT4G35A]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\n- This is a realistic positive use case. AI tools can definitely help with generating ideas and improving lesson plans. I would agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35B]: Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- This is also a real capability of AI - adaptive learning systems exist. I would agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35C]: Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\n- AI can provide personalized support, tutoring systems exist. I would agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35D]: Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs.\n- There are AI tools for accessibility, language learning, etc. I would agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35E]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- Grading, scheduling, attendance tracking can be automated with AI. I would agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35F]: Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a real concern - AI can be used for cheating/plagiarism. This is a valid concern. I would agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35G]: Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n- This is a valid concern - AI systems can make errors or inappropriate suggestions. I would agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35H]: Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\n- This is a documented issue with AI systems. I would agree with this concern.\n\n[TT4G35I]: Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\n- This is a valid concern with data privacy. I would agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35J]: Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches.\n\n\n- AI systems may lack understanding of sound teaching methods and could recommend approaches that don't align with educational research or student development.\n\nAs an educator, I recognize both the genuine benefits and legitimate risks. The positive applications around personalization, administrative efficiency, and accessibility are compelling, while the concerns about academic integrity, data protection, algorithmic bias, and pedagogical soundness are equally important to address thoughtfully in practice.",
