I need to provide responses to all 10 statements using the response options: 'Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', 'I don't know'.\n\nLet me think about reasonable responses from a teacher's perspective:\n\nTT4G35A - AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans: This is a positive statement about AI capabilities. Teachers would likely recognize this as a useful application. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35B - AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities: This is another positive pedagogical use. Teachers would likely see value in personalization. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35C - AI assists teachers in supporting students individually: Similar to above, this is a beneficial use. \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35D - AI supports students with specific needs: This is about accessibility and support for special needs. Teachers would likely see this as positive. \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35E - AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks: Teachers generally recognize administrative burden. This is positive. \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35F - AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own: This is about academic integrity risks/cheating. Teachers would be concerned about this as a real problem. \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35G - AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct: This acknowledges AI limitations/risks. Teachers would likely recognize this reality. \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35H - AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions: This is about algorithmic bias and potential negative effects. This is a valid concern. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35I - AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data: This is about data protection concerns. Teachers are likely concerned about this. \"Agree\"\n\n\nFor the final statement about unsuitable pedagogical approaches, I'd also respond \"Agree\" - teachers would recognize that AI systems might recommend methods that don't align with sound educational practice. My responses reflect a balanced perspective that acknowledges both the genuine benefits AI offers for lesson planning and personalized learning, while also recognizing legitimate concerns around academic integrity, data security, algorithmic bias, and the quality of AI recommendations.",
