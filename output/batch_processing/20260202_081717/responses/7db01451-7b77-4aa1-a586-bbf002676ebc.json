I need to provide responses to 10 statements using the available response options: 'Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', 'I don't know'.\n\nI should consider the perspective of a typical teacher from Latvia who would have some experience with or understanding of AI in education. Let me think about each statement:\n\nTT4G35A - AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans: This is a positive statement about AI's utility. Most teachers would likely agree this is possible - AI tools can help generate ideas and improve lessons. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35B - AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities: This is also positive - AI can personalize learning. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35C - AI assists teachers in supporting students individually: Similar to above, personalized support. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35D - AI supports students with specific needs: This is a positive application for accessibility. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35E - AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks: Teachers would generally appreciate this. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35F - AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own: This is a negative statement about AI's misuse potential. A teacher would likely agree this is a risk. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35G - AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct: This is a realistic concern about AI limitations. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35H - AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions: This is a concern about AI bias. I'll say \"Agree\" - this is a known concern\n\nTT4G35I - AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data: This is a significant concern for teachers/educators. \n\nFor the remaining statements, I recognize several key risks: data privacy concerns are particularly important in an educational context, AI may recommend pedagogical methods that don't align with effective teaching practices, and unsuitable approaches could undermine learning outcomes. I'll mark these as \"Agree\" since they represent legitimate concerns a teacher would acknowledge.",
