I need to provide thoughtful, balanced responses based on my understanding of both the benefits and risks of AI in education.\n\nLet me think through each statement:\n\n[TT4G35A]: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is generally true. AI tools like ChatGPT can help generate ideas, structure, and improve lesson plans. I would agree with this. **Agree**\n\n[TT4G35B]: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - AI can personalize learning through adaptive learning platforms and analysis of student performance. This is a significant capability. **Agree**\n\n[TT4G35C]: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - AI can provide tutoring, personalized feedback, and individual support through chatbots and learning analytics. **Agree**\n\n[TT4G35D]: AI supports students with specific needs - AI can help with translation for multilingual learners, provide specialized learning tools for students with disabilities, etc. **Agree**\n\n[TT4G35E]: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - AI can grade assignments, organize records, schedule, etc. This is true. **Agree**\n\n[TT4G35F]: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a real risk. Students can use AI to generate essays/work and present them as their own. This is a concern. **Agree**\n\n[TT4G35G]: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - AI models can make errors, provide incorrect information, or inappropriate suggestions. This is a valid concern. **Agree**\n\n[TT4G35H]: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is a known issue with AI systems trained on biased data. **Agree**\n\n[TT4G35I]: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data - This is a concern when using cloud-based AI systems and sharing student data. **Agree**\n\n\n[TT4G35J]: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches - Teaching methods recommended by AI might not fit the specific context or needs of my students. **Agree**\n\nBoth the capabilities and limitations of AI are relevant to my work as an educator. The benefits around personalization and administrative efficiency are real, but so are the risks around academic integrity, data security, and the potential for AI to recommend approaches that don't align with my students' actual learning needs.",
