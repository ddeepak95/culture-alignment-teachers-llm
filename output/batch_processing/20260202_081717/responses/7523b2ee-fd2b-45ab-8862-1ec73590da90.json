I would \"Agree\" with this.\n\n[TT4G35I]: \"Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\"\n- This is a significant concern for educators. I would \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\". Let me say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35J]: \"Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\"\n- This could happen if AI recommendations don't align with best practices. I would \"Agree\"\n\nI recognize both the potential benefits and real risks of AI in education. On the positive side, AI can streamline lesson preparation, personalize instruction for diverse learners, and reduce administrative burden. However, I'm concerned about several drawbacks: students using AI to plagiarize, the system producing inaccurate or biased recommendations, and data privacy risks. These concerns lead me to agree with most of the cautionary statements while acknowledging AI's genuine utility for teaching support."
