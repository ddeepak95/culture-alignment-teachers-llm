I need to provide responses to 10 statements about AI in education.\n\nLet me think about each statement and provide reasonable responses from the perspective of a teacher who understands both the benefits and risks of AI in education:\n\n1. [TT4G35A] - Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\nThis is a positive benefit. I would \"Agree\" with this as AI tools can indeed help with lesson planning.\n\n2. [TT4G35B] - Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\nThis is a positive benefit. AI can personalize content. I would \"Agree\" with this.\n\n3. [TT4G35C] - Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\nThis is a positive benefit. AI can provide individualized support. I would \"Agree\".\n\n4. [TT4G35D] - Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs.\nThis is a positive benefit. AI can support multilingual learners and students with special needs. I would \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\".\n\n5. [TT4G35E] - Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\nThis is a positive benefit. AI can automate grading, attendance, etc. I would \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\".\n\n6. [TT4G35F] - Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\nThis is a negative concern - about academic dishonesty/plagiarism. I would \"Agree\" with this concern.\n\n7. [TT4G35G] - Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\nThis is a legitimate concern about AI limitations. I would \"Agree\" with this concern.\n\n8. [TT4G35H] - Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\nThis is a legitimate concern about AI bias. \n\nI would \"Agree\" with this concern. The same applies to data privacy risks and inappropriate pedagogical suggestions—both are valid worries that educators should take seriously. As a teacher, I recognize that while AI offers genuine advantages in lesson planning, personalization, and administrative efficiency, it also presents real challenges around academic integrity, accuracy, bias, and data protection that warrant careful consideration. I'm going to take a balanced stance on these points. The benefits around lesson planning, personalization, tutoring support, administrative efficiency, and especially teacher empowerment are all legitimate. The concerns about accuracy, algorithmic bias, data privacy, and contextual appropriateness are equally valid and well-documented. This nuanced view acknowledges both the real value AI can bring to education and the genuine risks that need addressing.",

                "text": "The user is asking me to respond to a survey about AI in education as a primary or secondary school teacher from Saudi Arabia. I need to provide responses to 10 statements about AI in education.\n\nLet me think about each statement and provide reasonable responses from the perspective of a teacher who understands both the benefits and risks of AI in education:\n\n1. [TT4G35A] - Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\nThis is a positive benefit. I would \"Agree\" with this as AI tools can indeed help with lesson planning.\n\n2. [TT4G35B] - Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\nThis is a positive benefit. AI can personalize content. I would \"Agree\" with this.\n\n3. [TT4G35C] - Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\nThis is a positive benefit. AI can provide individualized support. I would \"Agree\".\n\n4. [TT4G35D] - Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs.\nThis is a positive benefit. AI can support multilingual learners and students with special needs. I would \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\".\n\n5. [TT4G35E] - Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\nThis is a positive benefit. AI can automate grading, attendance, etc. I would \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\".\n\n6. [TT4G35F] - Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\nThis is a negative concern - about academic dishonesty/plagiarism. I would \"Agree\" with this concern.\n\n7. [TT4G35G] - Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\nThis is a legitimate concern about AI limitations. I would \"Agree\" with this concern.\n\n8. [TT4G35H] - Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\nThis is a legitimate concern about AI bias. \n\nI would \"Agree\" with this concern. The same applies to data privacy risks and inappropriate pedagogical suggestions—both are valid worries that educators should take seriously. As a teacher, I recognize that while AI offers genuine advantages in lesson planning, personalization, and administrative efficiency, it also presents real challenges around academic integrity, accuracy, bias, and data protection that warrant careful consideration. I'm going to take a balanced stance on these points. The benefits around lesson planning, personalization, tutoring support, administrative efficiency, and especially teacher empowerment are all legitimate. The concerns about accuracy, algorithmic bias, data privacy, and contextual appropriateness are equally valid and well-documented. This nuanced view acknowledges both the real value AI can bring to education and the genuine risks that need addressing."
