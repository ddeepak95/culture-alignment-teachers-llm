I need to provide responses to 10 statements about AI in education.\n\nLet me think about how a thoughtful teacher from Azerbaijan might respond to these statements, considering both the benefits and risks of AI in education:\n\n[TT4G35A]: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is generally a positive application. I would say \"Agree\" - it's true that AI can help with this.\n\n[TT4G35B]: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is another positive use case. I would say \"Agree\" - personalization is a known benefit of AI.\n\n[TT4G35C]: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - This is also a positive application. I would say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35D]: AI supports students with specific needs - This is a positive and important benefit. I would say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35E]: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - This is clearly a positive benefit. I would say \"Strongly agree\" - this is one of the clearest benefits.\n\n[TT4G35F]: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a concerning risk. I would say \"Agree\" - this is a real concern with AI tools.\n\n[TT4G35G]: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - This is a valid concern. I would say \"Agree\" - AI systems can make errors.\n\n[TT4G35H]: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is a concerning risk. I would say \"Agree\" - this is a documented problem with AI systems.\n\n[TT4G35I]: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data - This is a significant concern. I would say \"Agree\" - data privacy is a real concern.\n\n[TT4G35J]: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches - This could happen. I would say \"Agree\" - AI might not understand proper pedagogical principles fully.\n\n\nI should provide responses that reflect both the genuine advantages AI offers in supporting teaching and learning, as well as the legitimate concerns educators need to consider when implementing these tools in classrooms.",
