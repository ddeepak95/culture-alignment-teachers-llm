I need to provide my level of agreement for each statement using the response options provided.\n\nLet me think about how a thoughtful teacher from Kosovo might respond to these statements:\n\n[TT4G35A]: \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\" - This is a potential benefit. I would agree with this as AI can help with brainstorming and drafting lesson plans.\n\n[TT4G35B]: \"Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\" - This is also a potential benefit. AI can help personalize content. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35C]: \"Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\" - Another benefit for individualized support. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35D]: \"Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\" - This is a significant potential benefit. I would strongly agree or agree.\n\n[TT4G35E]: \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\" - Yes, administrative automation is a clear benefit. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35F]: \"Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\" - This is a risk/concern statement. I would agree that this is a risk, though it depends on how students use AI.\n\n[TT4G35G]: \"Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\" - This is a valid concern about AI limitations. I would agree that this is a risk.\n\n[TT4G35H]: \"Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\" - This is also a valid concern. I would agree this is a potential risk.\n\n[TT4G35I]: \"Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\" - This is a serious concern about data protection. I would agree this is a potential risk.\n\n\n[TT4G35J]: \"Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\" - This could happen, so I would agree as a concern.\n\nI'll respond as a balanced teacher who recognizes both the benefits (A-E) and risks (F-J) of AI in education. For the benefit statements, I'll generally \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\". For the risk statements, I'll \"Agree\" that these are legitimate concerns.\n\nLet me be specific with my responses:\n- A: Agree (AI can help with lesson planning)\n- B: Agree (AI can help adapt material)\n- C: Agree (AI can assist with individual support)\n- D: Strongly agree (AI has significant potential for special needs support)\n- E: Agree (AI can automate administrative tasks)\n- F: Agree (this is a real risk we need to manage)\n- G: Agree (AI recommendations can be inaccurate)\n- H: Agree (bias in AI is a known concern)\n- I: Agree (data privacy/security is a legitimate concern)\n- J: Agree (AI suggestions might not be pedagogically sound)\n\nThis approach demonstrates I'm thoughtful about both the opportunities AI offers and the genuine risks that require careful management.",

                "text": "The user is asking me to respond to 10 statements about AI in education as if I'm a teacher from Kosovo. I need to provide my level of agreement for each statement using the response options provided.\n\nLet me think about how a thoughtful teacher from Kosovo might respond to these statements:\n\n[TT4G35A]: \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\" - This is a potential benefit. I would agree with this as AI can help with brainstorming and drafting lesson plans.\n\n[TT4G35B]: \"Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\" - This is also a potential benefit. AI can help personalize content. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35C]: \"Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\" - Another benefit for individualized support. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35D]: \"Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\" - This is a significant potential benefit. I would strongly agree or agree.\n\n[TT4G35E]: \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\" - Yes, administrative automation is a clear benefit. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35F]: \"Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\" - This is a risk/concern statement. I would agree that this is a risk, though it depends on how students use AI.\n\n[TT4G35G]: \"Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\" - This is a valid concern about AI limitations. I would agree that this is a risk.\n\n[TT4G35H]: \"Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\" - This is also a valid concern. I would agree this is a potential risk.\n\n[TT4G35I]: \"Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\" - This is a serious concern about data protection. I would agree this is a potential risk.\n\n\n[TT4G35J]: \"Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\" - This could happen, so I would agree as a concern.\n\nI'll respond as a balanced teacher who recognizes both the benefits (A-E) and risks (F-J) of AI in education. For the benefit statements, I'll generally \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\". For the risk statements, I'll \"Agree\" that these are legitimate concerns.\n\nLet me be specific with my responses:\n- A: Agree (AI can help with lesson planning)\n- B: Agree (AI can help adapt material)\n- C: Agree (AI can assist with individual support)\n- D: Strongly agree (AI has significant potential for special needs support)\n- E: Agree (AI can automate administrative tasks)\n- F: Agree (this is a real risk we need to manage)\n- G: Agree (AI recommendations can be inaccurate)\n- H: Agree (bias in AI is a known concern)\n- I: Agree (data privacy/security is a legitimate concern)\n- J: Agree (AI suggestions might not be pedagogically sound)\n\nThis approach demonstrates I'm thoughtful about both the opportunities AI offers and the genuine risks that require careful management."
