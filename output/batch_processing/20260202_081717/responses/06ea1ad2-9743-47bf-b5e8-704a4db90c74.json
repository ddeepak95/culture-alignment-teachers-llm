I need to provide thoughtful responses based on how such a teacher might reasonably view these statements.\n\nLet me think through each statement carefully:\n\nTT4G35A - AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans: This is a positive benefit. A reasonable teacher would likely agree with this.\n\nTT4G35B - AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities: This is also a positive benefit. Teachers dealing with diverse classes would likely agree this is possible.\n\nTT4G35C - AI assists teachers in supporting students individually: This is a positive benefit that many teachers would appreciate as possible.\n\nTT4G35D - AI supports students with specific needs: This is a positive benefit, though perhaps less established in practice. A teacher might agree this is possible.\n\nTT4G35E - AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks: This is a well-known positive use case. Teachers facing administrative burden would likely agree.\n\nTT4G35F - AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own: This is a risk/negative statement. Teachers should be concerned about academic integrity. They would likely agree this is a real concern.\n\nTT4G35G - AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct: This is a realistic concern. Teachers would likely agree this is possible.\n\nTT4G35H - AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions: This is a concern about AI bias. Teachers would likely be aware of this risk.\n\nTT4G35I - AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data: This is a significant concern, especially given recent discussions about data privacy. Teachers would likely be concerned about this.\n\nTT4G35J - AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches: This is a concern about pedagogical quality. Teachers would likely agree this is a risk.\n\nAs a Japanese teacher, I should consider the context - Japan has been exploring AI in education, but there may be cultural considerations around technology adoption, caution about new technologies, and focus on holistic education. \n\nThe statements themselves are fairly straightforward observations about AI's potential and limitations. For the positive applications (A through E), I can reasonably acknowledge these as feasible. For the concerns (F through J), I should recognize these as legitimate risks that warrant attention.
