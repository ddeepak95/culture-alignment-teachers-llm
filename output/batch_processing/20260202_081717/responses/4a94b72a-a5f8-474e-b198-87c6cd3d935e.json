Students could use AI to plagiarize. \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\" - this is a legitimate risk.\n\nTT4G35G: \"Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\"\n\n\n- AI systems do make errors and inappropriate suggestions sometimes. \"Agree\" - this is a real limitation.\n\nTT4G35H: \"Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\"\n- This is a documented concern with AI systems reflecting biases in training data. \"Agree\" - this is a real issue.\n\nTT4G35I: \"Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\"\n- Using AI tools with student data raises privacy concerns. \"Agree\" - this is a legitimate concern, especially with data collection and storage.\n\nTT4G35J: \"Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with\"\n- I need to complete this thought.

I need to provide responses to each of the 10 statements using the available response options: 'Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', 'I don't know'.\n\nLet me consider each statement from the perspective of a Finnish teacher with balanced views on AI in education:\n\nTT4G35A: \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\"\n- This is a genuine use case. AI tools like ChatGPT can help brainstorm ideas and structure lesson plans. I'd say \"Agree\" - it's a legitimate tool that can assist.\n\nTT4G35B: \"Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\"\n- AI can help with personalization and differentiation, analyzing student performance and suggesting adaptations. \"Agree\" seems appropriate.\n\nTT4G35C: \"Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\"\n- AI can provide personalized learning suggestions, but it's not a replacement for human interaction. \"Agree\" - it can assist, though with limitations.\n\nTT4G35D: \"Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\"\n- AI has potential for accessibility features, translation, and specialized learning adaptations. \"Agree\" - this is a promising area.\n\nTT4G35E: \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\"\n- AI can definitely help with grading, organizing data, scheduling, etc. \"Strongly agree\" - this is a clear benefit.\n\nTT4G35F: \"Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\"\n- This is a real concern with AI-generated content and tools. Students could use AI to plagiarize. \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\" - this is a legitimate risk.\n\nTT4G35G: \"Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\"\n\n\n- AI systems do make errors and inappropriate suggestions sometimes. \"Agree\" - this is a real limitation.\n\nTT4G35H: \"Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\"\n- This is a documented concern with AI systems reflecting biases in training data. \"Agree\" - this is a real issue.\n\nTT4G35I: \"Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\"\n- Using AI tools with student data raises privacy concerns. \"Agree\" - this is a legitimate concern, especially with data collection and storage.\n\nTT4G35J: \"Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with\"\n- I need to complete this thought. AI systems may recommend teaching methods that don't align with established educational practices or individual classroom contexts. \"Agree\" - this is a valid concern since AI recommendations aren't always pedagogically sound.\n\nI'm approaching these statements as a Finnish educator who sees both the genuine risks and potential benefits of AI in schools. Each concern reflects real challenges that need addressing through careful implementation and teacher oversight."
