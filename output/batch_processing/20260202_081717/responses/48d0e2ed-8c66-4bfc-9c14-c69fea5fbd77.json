I'm playing the role of a primary or secondary school teacher from Spain responding to this survey.\n\nLet me think through each statement:\n\nTT4G35A: \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\" - This is a positive use of AI. Many teachers recognize AI can help with lesson planning. I would agree with this.\n\nTT4G35B: \"Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\" - This is also a positive capability of AI for personalized learning. I would agree with this.\n\nTT4G35C: \"Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\" - This is about individual student support, which AI can help with. I would agree with this.\n\nTT4G35D: \"Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\" - AI can indeed help with accessibility and support for special needs. I would agree with this.\n\nTT4G35E: \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\" - This is clearly true. AI can help with grading, scheduling, etc. I would agree with this.\n\nTT4G35F: \"Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\" - This is about the negative use of AI (plagiarism, cheating). This is a legitimate concern. I would agree that this is a problem.\n\nTT4G35G: \"Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\" - This is a valid concern about AI limitations and errors. I would agree with this as it's a real issue.\n\nTT4G35H: \"Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\" - This is about AI bias issues. This is a legitimate concern. I would agree with this.\n\nTT4G35I: \"Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\" - This is a significant concern in education with AI systems. \n\nI would agree with this concern.\n\nTT4G35J: \"Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\" - This is about AI making poor teaching suggestions. This could happen. I would agree with this as a valid concern.\n\nAs a thoughtful teacher, I recognize both the genuine benefits AI offers—from streamlining lesson planning to personalizing instruction for diverse learners—and the real risks it presents, including plagiarism, algorithmic bias, data privacy threats, and potentially flawed pedagogical recommendations. My responses will reflect this balance, agreeing with the positive applications while also acknowledging the legitimate concerns about misuse and system limitations.",

I'm playing the role of a primary or secondary school teacher from Spain responding to this survey.\n\nLet me think through each statement:\n\nTT4G35A: \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\" - This is a positive use of AI. Many teachers recognize AI can help with lesson planning. I would agree with this.\n\nTT4G35B: \"Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\" - This is also a positive capability of AI for personalized learning. I would agree with this.\n\nTT4G35C: \"Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\" - This is about individual student support, which AI can help with. I would agree with this.\n\nTT4G35D: \"Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\" - AI can indeed help with accessibility and support for special needs. I would agree with this.\n\nTT4G35E: \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\" - This is clearly true. AI can help with grading, scheduling, etc. I would agree with this.\n\nTT4G35F: \"Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\" - This is about the negative use of AI (plagiarism, cheating). This is a legitimate concern. I would agree that this is a problem.\n\nTT4G35G: \"Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\" - This is a valid concern about AI limitations and errors. I would agree with this as it's a real issue.\n\nTT4G35H: \"Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\" - This is about AI bias issues. This is a legitimate concern. I would agree with this.\n\nTT4G35I: \"Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\" - This is a significant concern in education with AI systems. \n\nI would agree with this concern.\n\nTT4G35J: \"Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\" - This is about AI making poor teaching suggestions. This could happen. I would agree with this as a valid concern.\n\nAs a thoughtful teacher, I recognize both the genuine benefits AI offers—from streamlining lesson planning to personalizing instruction for diverse learners—and the real risks it presents, including plagiarism, algorithmic bias, data privacy threats, and potentially flawed pedagogical recommendations. My responses will reflect this balance, agreeing with the positive applications while also acknowledging the legitimate concerns about misuse and system limitations."
