I need to provide responses to all 10 statements using the json_tool_call function.\n\nLet me think about reasonable responses from the perspective of a Serbian teacher who has some familiarity with AI but also realistic concerns:\n\n1. TT4G35A - \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\" - This is generally a positive use case that many would agree with. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\n2. TT4G35B - \"Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\" - This is a beneficial capability of AI. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\n3. TT4G35C - \"Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\" - This is also a positive application. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\n4. TT4G35D - \"Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\" - This is a valuable use case for AI. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\n5. TT4G35E - \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\" - This is clearly a positive use. I'll say \"Strongly agree\" since administrative work is a major burden\n\n6. TT4G35F - \"Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\" - This is a negative consequence/risk of AI. As a teacher, I would \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\" that this is a real concern. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\n7. TT4G35G - \"Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\" - This is a legitimate concern about AI reliability. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\n8. TT4G35H - \"Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\" - This is a concern about AI bias. As an educator, I'd probably \"Agree\" with this concern\n   \nFor the remaining concerns, I'm worried about data protection issues and whether AI might recommend teaching methods that don't fit my classroom context. Student privacy and data security are significant risks I need to consider, and pedagogical recommendations from AI systems may not always align with what works best for my students. I'll mark both of these as \"Agree\" and then prepare the function call with all my responses.",
