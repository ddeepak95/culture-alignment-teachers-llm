I should provide thoughtful responses based on realistic perspectives a teacher might have about AI's role in education.\n\nLet me think through each statement:\n\nA) AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is generally positive and realistic. Many teachers find AI useful for this. I'd say \"Agree\" as this is a common beneficial use.\n\nB) AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is also positive and realistic. AI can help with differentiation. \"Agree\" seems appropriate.\n\nC) AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - This is positive and realistic. \"Agree\" is suitable.\n\nD) AI supports students with specific needs (multilingual learners, SEN) - This is positive and has good potential. \"Agree\" seems appropriate.\n\nE) AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - This is definitely true and widely recognized. \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\" would be appropriate. I'll say \"Agree\" as administrative automation is a real benefit.\n\nF) AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a legitimate concern about academic integrity. \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\" seems warranted.

I'll say \"Agree\" as this is a real concern, especially with GDPR considerations.\n\nJ) AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students - This is a reasonable concern. \"Agree\" seems appropriate.\n\nLet me provide balanced but realistic responses that reflect common teacher concerns and opportunities regarding AI.",
