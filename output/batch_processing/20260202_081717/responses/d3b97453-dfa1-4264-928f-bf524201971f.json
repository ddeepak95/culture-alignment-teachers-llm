I should provide thoughtful, balanced responses that reflect the perspective of an educator considering both the benefits and risks of AI in education.\n\nLet me think through each statement:\n\n[TT4G35A]: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is realistic. AI tools can assist with brainstorming, outlining, and suggesting content. I would \"Agree\" with this.\n\n[TT4G35B]: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is true. Adaptive learning systems can personalize content. I would \"Agree\" with this.\n\n[TT4G35C]: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - AI can provide personalized feedback and tutoring. I would \"Agree\" with this.\n\n[TT4G35D]: AI supports students with specific needs - AI can provide support for multilingual learners, accessibility features, etc. I would \"Agree\" with this.\n\n[TT4G35E]: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - This is clear. AI can automate grading, scheduling, data entry. I would \"Strongly agree\" with this.\n\n[TT4G35F]: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a risk. AI can be used to generate work that students pass off as their own. This is a concern. I would \"Agree\" with this as a risk that exists.\n\n[TT4G35G]: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - This is true. AI can make errors and provide incorrect suggestions. I would \"Agree\" with this.\n\n[TT4G35H]: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is a known concern with AI systems. I would \"Agree\" with this as a potential risk.\n\n[TT4G35I]: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data - This is a real concern with data handling. \n\nData protection is critical in educational settings, so I'd \"Agree\" that this represents a genuine risk.\n\n[TT4G35J]: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches - If AI recommendations don't align with established educational best practices, this could be problematic. I would \"Agree\" with this as a potential risk.\n\nNow I'll prepare these responses for submission.",
