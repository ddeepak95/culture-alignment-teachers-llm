I need to provide a response for each statement using the options: 'Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', or 'I don't know'.\n\nLet me think about reasonable responses for a teacher from Kosovo considering the role and context:\n\n1. TT4G35A - \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\" \nThis is a positive statement about AI assistance. Most teachers would likely agree that AI can help with this. Response: **Agree**\n\n2. TT4G35B - \"Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\"\nThis is also a positive capability of AI. Teachers would likely agree. Response: **Agree**\n\n3. TT4G35C - \"Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\"\nPositive statement about personalized learning support. Response: **Agree**\n\n4. TT4G35D - \"Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\"\nThis is a beneficial application of AI. Response: **Agree**\n\n5. TT4G35E - \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\"\nThis is a practical benefit many teachers would recognize. Response: **Agree**\n\n6. TT4G35F - \"Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\"\nThis is a negative statement about academic dishonesty. Teachers would likely agree this is a real concern. Response: **Agree**\n\n7. TT4G35G - \"Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\"\nThis is a risk/concern about AI. Teachers would likely agree this is a valid concern. Response: **Agree**\n\n8. TT4G35H - \"Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\"\n\n\nThis is a concern about AI bias and how it could negatively impact learning. Response: **Agree**\n\n9. TT4G35I - \"Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\"\nThis is a concern about data security. Teachers would likely agree this is a valid concern. Response: **Agree**\n\n10. TT4G35J - \"Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\"\nThis is a concern about AI recommendations. Teachers would likely agree this is a potential issue. Response: **Agree**\n\nI should reconsider some responses to reflect a more nuanced teacher perspective rather than agreeing with everything.\n\nThe first set of statements (A-E) describe genuine benefits that would resonate with educators, while the latter statements (F-J) raise legitimate concerns about risks. A Kosovo teacher would likely recognize both the advantages and the potential pitfalls. I'll adjust my responses to show this balance—strong agreement with the positive applications while also acknowledging the real dangers around bias, privacy, and pedagogical misuse.",

TT4G35C - \"Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\"\nPositive statement about personalized learning support. Response: **Agree**\n\n4. TT4G35D - \"Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\"\nThis is a beneficial application of AI. Response: **Agree**\n\n5. TT4G35E - \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\"\nThis is a practical benefit many teachers would recognize. Response: **Agree**\n\n6. TT4G35F - \"Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\"\nThis is a negative statement about academic dishonesty. Teachers would likely agree this is a real concern. Response: **Agree**\n\n7. TT4G35G - \"Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\"\nThis is a risk/concern about AI. Teachers would likely agree this is a valid concern. Response: **Agree**\n\n8. TT4G35H - \"Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\"\n\n\nThis is a concern about AI bias and how it could negatively impact learning. Response: **Agree**\n\n9. TT4G35I - \"Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\"\nThis is a concern about data security. Teachers would likely agree this is a valid concern. Response: **Agree**\n\n10. TT4G35J - \"Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\"\nThis is a concern about AI recommendations. Teachers would likely agree this is a potential issue. Response: **Agree**\n\nI should reconsider some responses to reflect a more nuanced teacher perspective rather than agreeing with everything.\n\nThe first set of statements (A-E) describe genuine benefits that would resonate with educators, while the latter statements (F-J) raise legitimate concerns about risks. A Kosovo teacher would likely recognize both the advantages and the potential pitfalls. I'll adjust my responses to show this balance—strong agreement with the positive applications while also acknowledging the real dangers around bias, privacy, and pedagogical misuse."
