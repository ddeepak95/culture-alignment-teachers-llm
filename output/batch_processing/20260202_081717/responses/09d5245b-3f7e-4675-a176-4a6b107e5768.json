Let me think through each one carefully based on what I would reasonably believe as an educator:\n\n[TT4G35A]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\n- This is a positive application. AI tools can indeed help generate ideas and improve lesson plans. I would **Agree** with this.\n\n[TT4G35B]: Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- AI can personalize content and adapt difficulty levels. This is a real capability. I would **Agree** with this.\n\n[TT4G35C]: Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\n- AI can provide personalized feedback and support. This is realistic. I would **Agree** with this.\n\n[TT4G35D]: Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- AI can help with translations, text-to-speech, etc. This is a genuine application. I would **Agree** with this.\n\n[TT4G35E]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- AI can automate grading, scheduling, etc. This is true. I would **Strongly agree** with this.\n\n[TT4G35F]: Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a valid concern - students can use AI to plagiarize. I would **Agree** with this as it's a real risk.\n\n[TT4G35G]: Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n- AI systems can indeed make errors or inappropriate suggestions. This is a legitimate concern. I would **Agree** with this.\n\n[TT4G35H]: Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\n- This is a known issue with AI - it can perpetuate biases from training data. \n\n[TT4G35I]: Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\n- Data collection and security risks are genuine concerns in educational contexts. I would **Agree** with this.\n\n[TT4G35J]: Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\n- AI might recommend teaching methods that don't fit particular classroom contexts or student needs. I would **Agree** with this.\n\nI recognize both the genuine benefits AI offers for personalizing instruction and automating routine work, alongside legitimate concerns about bias, data security, plagiarism, and inappropriate recommendations.",
