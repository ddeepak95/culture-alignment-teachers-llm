        "reasoning_content": "I need to respond to each of these 10 statements about AI in education as a primary or secondary school teacher from Vietnam. I should provide thoughtful responses based on realistic perspectives a teacher might have about AI's potential benefits and risks in education.\n\nLet me consider each statement:\n\nTT4G35A: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is generally positive. Most teachers would likely agree with this as AI tools can assist in content generation and planning.\n\nTT4G35B: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is also positive, as AI can provide personalization. Teachers would likely agree.\n\nTT4G35C: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - Positive statement. Teachers would likely agree as AI can provide personalized feedback and support.\n\nTT4G35D: AI supports students with specific needs - This is positive and increasingly true. Teachers would likely agree.\n\nTT4G35E: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - Positive statement about administrative efficiency. Teachers would likely agree.\n\nTT4G35F: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a negative statement about academic dishonesty. Teachers would likely agree this is a concern.\n\nTT4G35G: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - This is a concern/risk. Teachers would likely agree this is a potential issue.\n\nTT4G35H: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is a concern about bias. Teachers would likely agree this could be an issue.\n\nTT4G35I: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data - This is a concern. Teachers would likely agree this is a risk.\n\nTT4G35J: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches - This is a concern about AI suggesting poor teaching methods. Teachers would likely have some concern.\n\nAs a realistic teacher from Vietnam, I should provide balanced responses that acknowledge both benefits and risks of AI in education. I'll aim for:\n- Agreement on legitimate positive uses (TT4G35A-E)\n\n\n- Agreement on real concerns about misuse and risks (TT4G35F-J)\n\nLet me provide thoughtful responses that reflect both the opportunities and challenges I see with AI in my classroom.",
