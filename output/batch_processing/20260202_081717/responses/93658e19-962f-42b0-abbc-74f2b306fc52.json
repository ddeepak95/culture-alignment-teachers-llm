I need to provide responses to each of the 10 statements using the available response options: ['Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', 'I don't know'].\n\nLet me think about how a typical teacher from Kazakhstan might respond to these statements, considering both the benefits and risks of AI in education:\n\nTT4G35A - AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans: This is a positive benefit. Most teachers would likely agree with this as AI tools can help generate and improve lesson plans.\n\nTT4G35B - AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities: This is also a positive benefit regarding personalization. Teachers would likely agree.\n\nTT4G35C - AI assists teachers in supporting students individually: Another positive benefit. Teachers would likely agree.\n\nTT4G35D - AI supports students with specific needs: This is a positive benefit for accessibility. Teachers would likely agree.\n\nTT4G35E - AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks: A practical benefit. Teachers would likely agree.\n\nTT4G35F - AI enables students to misrepresent others' work: This is a negative concern. Teachers would likely agree this is a risk.\n\nTT4G35G - AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct: This is a legitimate concern. Teachers would likely agree this can happen.\n\nTT4G35H - AI amplifies biases: This is a concern about fairness. Teachers would likely agree this is possible.\n\nTT4G35I - AI jeopardises privacy and security of student data: This is a security concern. Teachers would likely agree this is a risk.\n\nTT4G35J - AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches: This is a concern about pedagogy. Teachers might agree this is possible.\n\nI'll provide responses that reflect a balanced but realistic perspective from a teacher who sees both benefits and risks of AI in education. I'll use \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\" for the positive statements about AI's benefits, and \"Agree\" for the negative statements about risks.\n\n\nNow I need to structure the responses for the JSON call.\n\nI cannot complete this thought as the next thinking is empty.",
