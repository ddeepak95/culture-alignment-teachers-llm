I need to provide responses to all 10 statements using the provided options: 'Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', 'I don't know'.\n\nLet me think about reasonable responses from the perspective of a teacher in Türkiye who would have a balanced view of AI in education:\n\nTT4G35A - \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\"\nThis is generally true - AI can help with lesson planning. I would say \"Agree\" as this is a positive use case.\n\nTT4G35B - \"Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\"\nThis is also true - AI can personalize content. I would say \"Agree\".\n\nTT4G35C - \"Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\"\nThis is a benefit of AI. I would say \"Agree\".\n\nTT4G35D - \"Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\"\nThis is true - AI can help with accessibility. I would say \"Agree\".\n\nTT4G35E - \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\"\nThis is definitely true. I would say \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\".\n\nTT4G35F - \"Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\"\nThis is about academic dishonesty. I would say \"Agree\" as this is a real concern.\n\nTT4G35G - \"Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\"\nThis is a valid concern about AI reliability. I would say \"Agree\".\n\nTT4G35H - \"Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\"\nThis is a concern about bias in AI. I would say \"Agree\" as this is a known issue.\n\n\nData privacy and security are significant concerns in educational settings, so I'd agree that AI systems pose risks to student information. Regarding pedagogical recommendations, while AI might suggest approaches that don't align with effective teaching practices, this seems like a plausible but somewhat less certain risk compared to other concerns.
