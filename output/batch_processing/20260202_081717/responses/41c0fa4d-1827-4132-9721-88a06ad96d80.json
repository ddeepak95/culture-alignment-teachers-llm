Response: \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35C]: Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\n- AI tutoring systems and personalized learning tools can support individual students. Response: \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35D]: Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- AI has potential here with translation tools, text-to-speech, etc., but this might be somewhat limited depending on implementation. A teacher might \"Agree\" but perhaps not \"Strongly agree\" given real-world limitations. Response: \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35E]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- AI can help with grading, scheduling, attendance tracking, etc. This is clearly true. Response: \"Strongly agree\"\n\n[TT4G35F]: Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a concern about academic dishonesty. AI tools like ChatGPT can generate text that students could pass off as their own. This is a real risk. Response: \"Strongly agree\" (acknowledging this is a genuine concern)\n \n[TT4G35G]: Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n- AI systems can produce inaccurate or unsuitable suggestions, which is a legitimate concern in educational contexts. Response: \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35H]: Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\n- Algorithmic bias is a recognized issue where AI can perpetuate or strengthen existing prejudices and false beliefs. Response: \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35I]: Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\n- Data protection is a major concern when implementing AI systems in schools, as student information could be at risk. Response: \"Strongly agree\"\n\n[TT4G35J]: Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\n- AI recommendations for teaching methods may not fit the specific context or learner needs. Response: \"Agree\"\n\nI should frame these responses as a thoughtful educator would—recognizing genuine risks while remaining open to how AI might still support teaching when implemented carefully."
