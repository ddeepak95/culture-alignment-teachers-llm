Let me think through each statement:\n\nTT4G35A: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is generally positive and many teachers would agree this is a helpful use case. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35B: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is also a positive capability.
