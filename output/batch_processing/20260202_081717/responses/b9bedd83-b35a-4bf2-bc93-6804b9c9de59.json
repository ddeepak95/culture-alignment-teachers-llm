I should provide thoughtful, balanced responses based on realistic teacher perspectives. Let me consider each statement:\n\n[TT4G35A]: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is a legitimate use case. Teachers might use AI to help generate ideas or improve their lesson plans. I would likely \"Agree\" with this.\n\n[TT4G35B]: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is a potential benefit of AI (personalization). I would likely \"Agree\" with this.\n\n[TT4G35C]: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - This is another potential benefit. I would likely \"Agree\" with this.\n\n[TT4G35D]: AI supports students with specific needs - This could be true, for example translation tools for multilingual learners. I would likely \"Agree\" with this.\n\n[TT4G35E]: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - This is definitely true and beneficial. Teachers spend a lot of time on admin. I would \"Strongly agree\" with this.\n\n[TT4G35F]: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a concern (plagiarism/cheating). As a teacher, I would be concerned about this. I would \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\" with this concern.\n\n[TT4G35G]: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - This is a legitimate concern. AI can make mistakes. I would \"Agree\" with this.\n\n[TT4G35H]: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is a concern but might be \"I don't know\" or \"Agree\" depending on awareness.\n\n[TT4G35I]: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data - This is a legitimate concern for teachers. I would \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\" with this.\n\n\n[TT4G35J]: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches - Teachers could follow AI recommendations without critical evaluation, which is problematic. I would \"Agree\" with this concern as well.\n\nI should provide balanced responses that acknowledge both the genuine advantages AI offers in education and the real risks that concern educators like myself.",
