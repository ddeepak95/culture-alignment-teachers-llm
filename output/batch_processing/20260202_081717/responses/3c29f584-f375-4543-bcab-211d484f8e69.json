I need to provide responses to 10 statements about AI's role and impact in education.\n\nLet me think about what a Lithuanian teacher might reasonably respond to each statement:\n\n1. **TT4G35A** - AI helps teachers write/improve lesson plans: This is a positive use case. Most teachers would likely agree this is possible. I'll respond with \"Agree\"\n\n2. **TT4G35B** - AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities: This is also a positive capability of AI. \"Agree\"\n\n3. **TT4G35C** - AI assists teachers in supporting students individually: Reasonable positive use case. \"Agree\"\n\n4. **TT4G35D** - AI supports students with specific needs (multilingual, SEN): This is a positive application. \"Agree\"\n\n5. **TT4G35E** - AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks: Valid use case. \"Agree\"\n\n6. **TT4G35F** - AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own: This is a negative/risk statement about academic dishonesty. A teacher would likely \"Agree\" that AI does enable this risk.\n\n7. **TT4G35G** - AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct: This is a legitimate concern about AI accuracy/reliability. \"Agree\"\n\n8. **TT4G35H** - AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions: This is a concern about bias in AI. \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\" would be reasonable - I'll say \"Agree\"\n\n9. **TT4G35I** - AI jeopardises privacy and security of student data: This is a legitimate concern about data protection. \"Agree\"\n\n10. **TT4G35J** - AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use: This is a concern about AI recommendations not being educationally sound. \"Agree\"\n\n\nI should present a nuanced perspective that acknowledges both the genuine pedagogical benefits AI can offer—like personalizing instruction and reducing administrative burden—while also recognizing the substantive concerns around academic integrity, data security, and the potential for AI systems to reinforce biases or provide educationally unsound recommendations.",
