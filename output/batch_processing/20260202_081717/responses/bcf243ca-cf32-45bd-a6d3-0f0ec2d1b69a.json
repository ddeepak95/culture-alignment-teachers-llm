I should provide thoughtful responses based on my understanding of AI's applications and limitations in education.\n\nLet me think about each statement:\n\n[TT4G35A]: AI helping teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is a positive potential use. I would agree with this as AI tools can indeed assist with generating ideas and improving lesson plans.\n\n[TT4G35B]: AI enabling teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is also a positive potential use. AI can help personalize content. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35C]: AI assisting teachers in supporting students individually - This is a positive use of AI. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35D]: AI supporting students with specific needs - This is a positive use, especially for accessibility. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35E]: AI helping teachers automate administrative tasks - This is definitely true. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35F]: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a risk/concern. I would agree that this is a concern, though it's more of an enabling factor than something AI directly does.\n\n[TT4G35G]: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - This is true, AI can make errors. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35H]: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is a concern. I would agree this is a potential risk.\n\n[TT4G35I]: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data - This is a concern, though depends on implementation. I would agree this is a risk.\n\n[TT4G35J]: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches - This is possible. I would agree this is a concern.\n\nLet me provide balanced responses as an educator would, considering both the benefits and risks of AI in education.",
