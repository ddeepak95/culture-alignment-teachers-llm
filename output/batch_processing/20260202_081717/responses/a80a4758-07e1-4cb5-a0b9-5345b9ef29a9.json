I need to provide thoughtful responses based on a balanced perspective that acknowledges both the benefits and challenges of AI in education.\n\nLet me think about each statement:\n\n[TT4G35A]: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is generally a positive use case. I would agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35B]: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is a positive capability.

I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35F]: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a concern/risk. As a teacher, I would acknowledge this is a real concern. I would agree that this is a risk.\n\n[TT4G35G]: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - This is a legitimate concern. I would agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35H]: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is a concern. I would agree this is a potential risk.\n\n[TT4G35I]: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data - This is a legitimate concern. I would agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35J]: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches - This could happen.
