I need to provide responses to 10 statements about AI in education.\n\nLet me think about reasonable responses from a Swedish teacher's perspective who has a balanced but somewhat cautious view of AI in education:\n\nTT4G35A - \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\" - This is clearly a positive capability of AI. Many teachers would agree with this as AI tools can help brainstorm and structure lesson plans. I'd say: Agree\n\nTT4G35B - \"Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\" - AI can definitely help with differentiation. This is a positive capability. I'd say: Agree\n\nTT4G35C - \"Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\" - AI can provide personalized feedback and support. I'd say: Agree\n\nTT4G35D - \"Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\" - AI has real potential here with assistive technology and translation. I'd say: Agree\n\nTT4G35E - \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\" - This is factually true and widely recognized. I'd say: Strongly agree\n\nTT4G35F - \"Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\" - This is a real concern with tools like ChatGPT. A teacher would likely agree with this as a risk. I'd say: Agree\n\nTT4G35G - \"Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\" - This is a valid concern about AI reliability and accuracy. I'd say: Agree\n\nTT4G35H - \"Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\" - This is a known issue with AI systems trained on biased data. I'd say: Agree\n\nTT4G35I - \"Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\" - This is a real concern with data collection and storage. \n\nTT4G35J - \"Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\" - This is possible but perhaps less commonly observed. A teacher might be cautious here. I'd say: Agree\n\nNow I need to structure these responses properly for the function call.",
