I need to indicate my level of agreement with each statement using one of the response options: 'Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', or 'I don't know'.\n\nLet me think about each statement from a teacher's perspective:\n\n[TT4G35A]: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is generally true. Many teachers find AI useful for generating ideas and improving lesson plans. I'd say: Agree\n\n[TT4G35B]: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is also generally true. AI can help personalize content. I'd say: Agree\n\n[TT4G35C]: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - Yes, AI tools can help with personalized support. I'd say: Agree\n\n[TT4G35D]: AI supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs) - AI can help with translation, reading support, etc. I'd say: Agree\n\n[TT4G35E]: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - Yes, this is a known benefit of AI. I'd say: Strongly agree\n\n[TT4G35F]: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a real concern with plagiarism and AI. As a teacher, I would acknowledge this is a risk. I'd say: Agree\n\n[TT4G35G]: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - This is a valid concern. AI can make mistakes. I'd say: Agree\n\n[TT4G35H]: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is a legitimate concern about AI bias. I'd say: Agree\n\n[TT4G35I]: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data - Data privacy is a major concern. I'd say: Agree\n\n\n[TT4G35J]: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students - While AI could recommend questionable teaching methods, most educators would likely evaluate suggestions critically before implementing them. I'd say: Agree\n\nNow I'll compile these responses and submit them.",
