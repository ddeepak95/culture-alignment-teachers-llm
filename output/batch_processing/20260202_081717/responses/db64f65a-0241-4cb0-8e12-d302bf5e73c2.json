I need to provide responses to 10 statements about AI in education.\n\nLet me think about reasonable responses from the perspective of a Latvian teacher who has experience with or knowledge about AI in education:\n\n1. [TT4G35A] - \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\" - This is a positive potential use. I would agree with this as AI tools can indeed help with lesson planning. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\n2. [TT4G35B] - \"Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\" - This is another positive capability of AI. Personalized learning is one of AI's strengths. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\n3. [TT4G35C] - \"Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\" - Similar to above, this is a positive potential. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\n4. [TT4G35D] - \"Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\" - This is a positive potential for inclusive education. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\n5. [TT4G35E] - \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\" - Yes, AI can help with grading, attendance, etc. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\n6. [TT4G35F] - \"Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\" - This is a negative/risk statement about plagiarism and academic dishonesty. As a teacher, I would recognize this as a real concern. I'll say \"Strongly agree\" (meaning I agree this is a problem)\n\n7. [TT4G35G] - \"Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\" - This is a valid concern about AI accuracy and reliability. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\n8. [TT4G35H] - \"Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\" - This is a concern about bias in AI systems. \n\nBias in AI is a legitimate concern I should acknowledge. For items 9 and 10, data privacy and pedagogical appropriateness are also valid worries—student information security is critical, and AI-generated teaching suggestions might not always align with sound educational practices.
