Many teachers would likely agree with this as AI can help brainstorm and organize ideas. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\nB) AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is a positive potential of AI. AI could analyze student performance and suggest adaptations. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\nC) AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - This is about personalized learning support. AI could help with this, though there are limitations.

I'd say \"Agree\"\n\nE) AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - This is clearly true and valuable. Most teachers would agree. \"Strongly agree\"\n\nF) AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a risk/negative aspect.
