I need to provide my perspective on both the benefits and risks/concerns about AI in educational settings.\n\nLet me think through each statement:\n\n[TT4G35A]: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is a reasonable application. I would agree with this as AI tools can assist with generating and refining lesson content. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35B]: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is a promising capability that AI could offer for differentiation. I would \"Agree\" with this.\n\n[TT4G35C]: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - Personalized learning and individual support is something AI could facilitate. I would \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35D]: AI supports students with specific needs - Adaptive technologies for multilingual learners and students with special needs is an area where AI shows potential. I would \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35E]: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - This is clearly true and beneficial. Administrative burden is significant for teachers. I would \"Strongly agree\"\n\n[TT4G35F]: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a legitimate concern with tools like ChatGPT. This is a risk. I would \"Agree\" (this is a negative aspect but a real concern)\n\n[TT4G35G]: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - AI systems do have limitations and can make errors. I would \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35H]: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is a known risk with AI systems trained on biased data. I would \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35I]: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data - Data privacy is a significant concern with AI systems. I would \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35J]: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students - This is possible if AI systems lack educational expertise. I would \"Agree\"\n\n\nNow I need to format these responses for submission. I'll organize my answers with the corresponding response codes for each statement.",
