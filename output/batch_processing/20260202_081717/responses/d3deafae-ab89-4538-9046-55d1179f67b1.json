I should provide thoughtful, balanced responses that reflect reasonable positions a teacher might hold about AI in educational contexts.\n\nLet me think through each statement:\n\nTT4G35A: AI helps teachers write/improve lesson plans - This is generally a positive application. Many teachers would agree AI can assist with this. I'd say \"Agree\".\n\nTT4G35B: AI enables adaptation of material to different abilities - This is a beneficial capability. I'd say \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\". Let me go with \"Agree\" as it's acknowledging the potential while being somewhat measured.\n\nTT4G35C: AI assists in supporting students individually - This is positive. I'd say \"Agree\".\n\nTT4G35D: AI supports students with specific needs - This is a beneficial application. I'd say \"Agree\".\n\nTT4G35E: AI helps automate administrative tasks - This is clearly beneficial for teachers. I'd say \"Strongly agree\" or \"Agree\". Let me say \"Agree\" to be somewhat balanced.\n\nTT4G35F: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work - This is a concern/risk. As a teacher, I'd \"Agree\" that this is a concern or \"Strongly agree\". Let me say \"Agree\" to acknowledge it's a real risk.\n\nTT4G35G: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate/correct - This is a legitimate concern. I'd say \"Agree\".\n\nTT4G35H: AI amplifies biases/misconceptions - This is a known concern. I'd say \"Agree\".\n\nTT4G35I: AI jeopardises privacy/security of data - This is a concern. I'd say \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\". Let me say \"Agree\".\n\nTT4G35J: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches - This is a concern about misapplication. \n\nI'd say \"Agree\" here as well. I want to present a perspective that recognizes both the genuine advantages AI offers—like streamlining lesson planning and personalizing instruction—while taking seriously the real risks around academic integrity, data security, and the potential for AI systems to reinforce existing biases or recommend approaches that don't fit my students' actual needs.",
