I need to provide responses to 10 statements about AI.\n\nLet me think about what a thoughtful teacher from Norway might respond to each of these statements. I should provide balanced, evidence-based responses that consider both the benefits and risks of AI in education.\n\n1. [TT4G35A] - AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans: This is generally true and positive. I'd say \"Agree\" - AI tools can indeed help with lesson planning.\n\n2. [TT4G35B] - AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities: This is also true, adaptive learning systems exist. I'd say \"Agree\".\n\n3. [TT4G35C] - AI assists teachers in supporting students individually: AI can provide personalized feedback and support. I'd say \"Agree\".\n\n4. [TT4G35D] - AI supports students with specific needs: Yes, AI can help with accessibility and multilingual support. I'd say \"Agree\".\n\n5. [TT4G35E] - AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks: Yes, this is a clear benefit. I'd say \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\".\n\n6. [TT4G35F] - AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own: This is a risk/concern. A teacher would likely \"Agree\" with this as a concern, meaning they agree this is something AI enables.\n\n7. [TT4G35G] - AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct: This is true - AI systems can make errors. I'd say \"Agree\".\n\n8. [TT4G35H] - AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions: This is a valid concern about AI. I'd say \"Agree\".\n\n9. [TT4G35I] - AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data: This is a legitimate concern. \n\nFor the remaining items, I need to consider the risks alongside the potential benefits. Data privacy is a serious issue that I'd agree with as a concern. The final statement about unsuitable pedagogical approaches is also a valid risk - AI systems might suggest teaching methods that don't align with sound educational practice or individual student needs. I'd likely agree with both of these as legitimate concerns a teacher should be aware of.",
