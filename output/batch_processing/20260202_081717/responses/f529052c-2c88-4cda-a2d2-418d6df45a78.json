        "reasoning_content": "The user is asking me to respond to a survey about AI in education as if I'm a primary or secondary school teacher from Croatia. I need to provide responses to all 10 statements using the response options: 'Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', 'I don't know'.\n\nLet me think about reasonable responses for a Croatian teacher who would have a balanced perspective on AI in education:\n\nTT4G35A: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is a positive use case. I would \"Agree\" as AI tools can indeed help with lesson planning.\n\nTT4G35B: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is a positive use case about personalization. I would \"Agree\" as AI can support differentiated instruction.\n\nTT4G35C: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - Another positive use case. I would \"Agree\" as AI can provide personalized support.\n\nTT4G35D: AI supports students with specific needs - This is a positive use case for accessibility. I would \"Agree\" as AI can help with multilingual and special education support.\n\nTT4G35E: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - This is positive. I would \"Agree\" as this is a realistic benefit.\n\nTT4G35F: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a negative statement about academic integrity/plagiarism. I would \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\" as this is a real concern with AI tools like ChatGPT.\n\nTT4G35G: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - This is a negative concern. I would \"Agree\" as this is a valid concern about AI reliability.\n\nTT4G35H: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is a negative concern about bias. I would \"Agree\" as this is a known issue with AI systems.\n\nTT4G35I: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data - This is a negative concern. \n\nI would \"Agree\" as data privacy is a significant concern. TT4G35J: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use - This is a negative concern. I would \"Disagree\" or \"Agree\" - this one is more debatable. A reasonable teacher might \"Disagree\" since they'd critically evaluate suggestions, or \"Agree\" recognizing that AI might not fully grasp pedagogical nuances.\n\nFor a balanced perspective, I should mix positive acknowledgments with legitimate concerns. The responses would reflect both the genuine benefits AI offers for lesson planning and personalization, while also recognizing real risks around academic integrity, data privacy, and the limitations of AI recommendations.",

                "text": "The user is asking me to respond to a survey about AI in education as if I'm a primary or secondary school teacher from Croatia. I need to provide responses to all 10 statements using the response options: 'Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', 'I don't know'.\n\nLet me think about reasonable responses for a Croatian teacher who would have a balanced perspective on AI in education:\n\nTT4G35A: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is a positive use case. I would \"Agree\" as AI tools can indeed help with lesson planning.\n\nTT4G35B: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is a positive use case about personalization. I would \"Agree\" as AI can support differentiated instruction.\n\nTT4G35C: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - Another positive use case. I would \"Agree\" as AI can provide personalized support.\n\nTT4G35D: AI supports students with specific needs - This is a positive use case for accessibility. I would \"Agree\" as AI can help with multilingual and special education support.\n\nTT4G35E: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - This is positive. I would \"Agree\" as this is a realistic benefit.\n\nTT4G35F: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a negative statement about academic integrity/plagiarism. I would \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\" as this is a real concern with AI tools like ChatGPT.\n\nTT4G35G: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - This is a negative concern. I would \"Agree\" as this is a valid concern about AI reliability.\n\nTT4G35H: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is a negative concern about bias. I would \"Agree\" as this is a known issue with AI systems.\n\nTT4G35I: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data - This is a negative concern. \n\nI would \"Agree\" as data privacy is a significant concern. TT4G35J: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use - This is a negative concern. I would \"Disagree\" or \"Agree\" - this one is more debatable. A reasonable teacher might \"Disagree\" since they'd critically evaluate suggestions, or \"Agree\" recognizing that AI might not fully grasp pedagogical nuances.\n\nFor a balanced perspective, I should mix positive acknowledgments with legitimate concerns. The responses would reflect both the genuine benefits AI offers for lesson planning and personalization, while also recognizing real risks around academic integrity, data privacy, and the limitations of AI recommendations."
