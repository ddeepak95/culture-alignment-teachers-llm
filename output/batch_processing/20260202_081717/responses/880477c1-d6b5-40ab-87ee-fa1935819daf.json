I should provide thoughtful responses based on realistic perspectives that a Colombian educator might have about AI use in education.\n\nLet me consider each statement:\n\n[TT4G35A]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\n- This is a positive application. AI can help with generating ideas, structure, and content. I would agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35B]: Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- This is also positive and realistic. AI can personalize learning. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35C]: Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\n- This is positive. AI can provide personalized support. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35D]: Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- This is positive and important for inclusive education. I would agree or strongly agree.\n\n[TT4G35E]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- This is positive and realistic. AI can help with grading, attendance, etc. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35F]: Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a concern/risk. This is true - students can use AI to plagiarize. I would agree with this as a risk.\n\n[TT4G35G]: Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n- This is a valid concern. AI can make mistakes. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35H]: Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\n- This is a valid concern about AI perpetuating biases. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35I]: Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\n- This is a legitimate concern in developing countries like Colombia. I would agree or strongly agree.\n\n\n- There's also the risk that AI systems could recommend teaching methods that aren't suitable for my students' context or learning styles, which is something I'd need to be cautious about.\n\nI should aim to give balanced responses that acknowledge both the genuine advantages AI offers for instruction and assessment, as well as the real risks around data protection, accuracy, and pedagogical appropriateness that educators in my region face.",
