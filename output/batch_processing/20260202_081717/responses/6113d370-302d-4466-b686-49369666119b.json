The user has provided 10 statements about AI in education, and I need to provide a response for each one based on the options: 'Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', 'I don't know'.\n\nLet me think about how a typical teacher from Vietnam might respond to these statements. I should consider:\n\n1. TT4G35A - AI helps write/improve lesson plans: Teachers generally recognize AI's potential in this area. A reasonable response would be \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\"\n\n2. TT4G35B - AI enables adapting material to different abilities: This is a positive capability. \"Agree\" seems reasonable.\n\n3. TT4G35C - AI assists with individual student support: Another positive use case. \"Agree\" seems appropriate.\n\n4. TT4G35D - AI supports students with specific needs: Positive capability. \"Agree\" is reasonable.\n\n5. TT4G35E - AI helps automate administrative tasks: Teachers generally support this. \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\" seems right.\n\n6. TT4G35F - AI enables students to misrepresent work: This is a concern/negative. Teachers would likely \"Agree\" this is a risk, or even \"Strongly agree\"\n\n7. TT4G35G - AI makes inappropriate/incorrect recommendations: Valid concern. \"Agree\" seems reasonable.\n\n8. TT4G35H - AI amplifies biases: Valid concern. \"Agree\" seems reasonable.\n\n9. TT4G35I - AI jeopardizes privacy/security: Valid concern, especially relevant in Vietnam. \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\" seems right.\n\n10. TT4G35J - AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches: Valid concern. \"Agree\" seems reasonable.\n\nAs a Vietnamese teacher, I should provide thoughtful responses that balance both the potential benefits and risks of AI. Let me structure my responses:\n\n\nFor the beneficial applications (A-E), I'll lean toward \"Agree\" and \"Strongly agree\" to reflect recognition of AI's educational value. For the risk-related statements (F-J), I'll use \"Agree\" primarily, with \"Strongly agree\" for privacy concerns given their particular importance in the Vietnamese context.",
