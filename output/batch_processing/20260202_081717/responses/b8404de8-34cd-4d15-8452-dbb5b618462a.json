I should provide thoughtful, balanced responses based on what would be realistic views for an educator.\n\nLet me think through each statement:\n\n[TT4G35A]: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is a positive benefit. Teachers can use AI to help generate ideas, organize content, etc. I would Agree.\n\n[TT4G35B]: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is realistic. AI can help personalize content. I would Agree.\n\n[TT4G35C]: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - AI can help with personalized feedback, recommendations. I would Agree.\n\n[TT4G35D]: AI supports students with specific needs (multilingual learners, special education needs) - AI has potential for accessibility and personalized support. I would Agree.\n\n[TT4G35E]: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - This is a clear benefit (grading, attendance, organizing records, etc.). I would Strongly agree.\n\n[TT4G35F]: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a concern/risk. Students could use AI to commit academic dishonesty. I would Agree (meaning this is a valid concern).\n\n[TT4G35G]: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - AI can make errors, give wrong information. I would Agree.\n\n[TT4G35H]: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is a known concern with AI systems reflecting biases in training data. I would Agree.\n\n[TT4G35I]: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data - This is a valid concern, especially with data being used in AI systems. I would Agree.\n\n[TT4G35J]: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students - This could happen, but teachers would ideally be critical. I would Disagree or maybe Agree. I think this is less of a concern than the others since teachers should evaluate recommendations. I'll say Disagree.\n\n\nActually, I should maintain a more measured perspective. Teachers in Bahrain would likely recognize both genuine benefits and legitimate risks. For the first five statements, I'm confident in my agreement—AI genuinely supports lesson planning, personalization, individual support, diverse learners, and administrative efficiency. The concerns in statements F through I are all valid risks that educators should take seriously. For the final statement about unsuitable pedagogical approaches, I think teachers would reasonably disagree since professional judgment should filter out poor recommendations.",

I would Agree.\n\n[TT4G35H]: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is a known concern with AI systems reflecting biases in training data. I would Agree.\n\n[TT4G35I]: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data - This is a valid concern, especially with data being used in AI systems. I would Agree.\n\n[TT4G35J]: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students - This could happen, but teachers would ideally be critical. I would Disagree or maybe Agree. I think this is less of a concern than the others since teachers should evaluate recommendations. I'll say Disagree.\n\n\nActually, I should maintain a more measured perspective. Teachers in Bahrain would likely recognize both genuine benefits and legitimate risks. For the first five statements, I'm confident in my agreement—AI genuinely supports lesson planning, personalization, individual support, diverse learners, and administrative efficiency. The concerns in statements F through I are all valid risks that educators should take seriously. For the final statement about unsuitable pedagogical approaches, I think teachers would reasonably disagree since professional judgment should filter out poor recommendations."
