        "reasoning_content": "The user is asking me to respond to a survey about AI in education as if I'm a primary or secondary school teacher from French Community (Belgium). I need to provide thoughtful responses to each statement based on a balanced perspective of AI's benefits and risks in education.\n\nLet me think through each statement:\n\nTT4G35A: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is a positive use case. AI tools like ChatGPT can help brainstorm, structure, and improve lesson plans. I would AGREE with this.\n\nTT4G35B: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is a beneficial capability. Adaptive learning systems can personalize content. I would AGREE with this.\n\nTT4G35C: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - Personalized learning and tutoring systems can help. I would AGREE with this.\n\nTT4G35D: AI supports students with specific needs - AI can help with accessibility, translation, and personalized support for students with special needs. I would AGREE with this.\n\nTT4G35E: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - This is true, AI can help with grading, scheduling, etc. I would AGREE with this.\n\nTT4G35F: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a real concern/risk with tools like ChatGPT for plagiarism. I would AGREE with this concern.\n\nTT4G35G: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - This is a valid concern, AI can make errors or inappropriate suggestions. I would AGREE with this concern.\n\nTT4G35H: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is a known issue with AI trained on biased data. I would AGREE with this concern.\n\nTT4G35I: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data - This is a legitimate concern about data protection. I would AGREE with this concern.\n\nTT4G35J: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches - This is possible if AI isn't properly trained or configured. \n\nFor the final statement, I recognize this as a legitimate risk as well. As a teacher, I'd take a balanced stance across the survey—acknowledging the genuine pedagogical benefits AI offers while remaining vigilant about the significant concerns around academic integrity, data protection, algorithmic bias, and the quality of AI-generated recommendations.",
