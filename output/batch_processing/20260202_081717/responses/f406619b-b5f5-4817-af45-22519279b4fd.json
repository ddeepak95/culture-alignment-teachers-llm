I need to provide responses to each of these 10 statements about AI in education. \n\nThe statements cover both positive and negative aspects of AI in education:\n- Positive: TT4G35A through TT4G35E (helping with lesson plans, adapting materials, supporting students, meeting special needs, automating admin tasks)\n- Negative: TT4G35F through TT4G35J (misrepresenting work, incorrect recommendations, amplifying biases, data privacy concerns, unsuitable pedagogical approaches)\n\nAs a teacher, I should consider both the benefits and risks of AI. I'll provide balanced responses that acknowledge the potential of AI while also being aware of its limitations and risks.\n\nLet me think about appropriate responses:\n\nTT4G35A: AI can definitely help write or improve lesson plans - this is a clear positive use. I would agree with this.\n\nTT4G35B: AI can help adapt materials to different abilities - this is a positive capability. I would agree.\n\nTT4G35C: AI can assist in supporting students individually through personalized learning - I would agree.\n\nTT4G35D: AI can support students with specific needs - this is true for things like text-to-speech, language support, etc. I would agree.\n\nTT4G35E: AI can definitely help automate administrative tasks like grading, attendance, etc. I would strongly agree.\n\nTT4G35F: This is a risk - students can use AI to misrepresent work. This is unfortunately true, so I would agree.\n\nTT4G35G: AI can make recommendations that are incorrect - this is a known limitation. I would agree.\n\nTT4G35H: AI can amplify biases - this is a documented concern. I would agree.\n\nTT4G35I: Privacy and security of student data is a legitimate concern with AI systems. I would agree.\n\nTT4G35J: AI might suggest pedagogical approaches that aren't suitable - this is possible. \n\nFor all of these, I need to provide thoughtful responses that reflect a teacher's balanced perspective on AI in education, acknowledging both its promise and its pitfalls.",
