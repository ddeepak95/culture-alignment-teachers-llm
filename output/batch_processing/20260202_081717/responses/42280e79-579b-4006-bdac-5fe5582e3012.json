I need to provide responses to 10 statements about AI in education.\n\nLet me think about reasonable responses from the perspective of a teacher in Kazakhstan:\n\n1. [TT4G35A]: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is a positive statement about AI. As a teacher, I would likely agree that AI can assist with this. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\n2. [TT4G35B]: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is also a positive capability of AI. I would agree with this. \"Agree\"\n\n3. [TT4G35C]: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - This is a positive statement about personalized learning support. \"Agree\"\n\n4. [TT4G35D]: AI supports students with specific needs - This is about AI helping multilingual learners and students with special needs. This is generally positive. \"Agree\"\n\n5. [TT4G35E]: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - This is positive. \"Agree\"\n\n6. [TT4G35F]: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a negative statement about academic dishonesty. A teacher would likely agree that this is a concern. \"Agree\"\n\n7. [TT4G35G]: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - This is a concern about AI reliability. As a teacher, I would acknowledge this risk. \"Agree\"\n\n8. [TT4G35H]: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is a concern about bias in AI. This is a valid concern. \"Agree\"\n\n9. [TT4G35I]: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data - This is a concern about data privacy. This is a valid concern that many teachers would have. \"Agree\"\n\n10. [TT4G35J]: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students - This is a concern about AI making poor pedagogical suggestions. \n\nI recognize both the benefits AI offers—from streamlining lesson planning and personalizing instruction to supporting diverse learners—and the legitimate concerns around academic integrity, data security, algorithmic bias, and pedagogical appropriateness. My responses reflect this balanced perspective, acknowledging that while AI has genuine potential to enhance teaching, these risks require careful consideration and safeguards.",
