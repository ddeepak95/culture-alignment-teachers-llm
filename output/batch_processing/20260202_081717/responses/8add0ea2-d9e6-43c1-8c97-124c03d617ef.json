I need to provide one response for each statement from the options: ['Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', 'I don't know'].\n\nLet me consider these statements thoughtfully as a teacher would:\n\nTT4G35A - AI helps with lesson plans: This is a reasonable positive application. I would likely \"Agree\" as AI tools can assist with generating ideas and organizing content.\n\nTT4G35B - AI adapts material for different abilities: This is a genuine capability of AI. I would \"Agree\" that AI can help personalize learning materials.\n\nTT4G35C - AI assists in individual student support: This is a positive application. I would \"Agree\" that AI can help provide more personalized support.\n\nTT4G35D - AI supports students with specific needs: This is true - AI can provide translations, text-to-speech, etc. I would \"Agree\" strongly.\n\nTT4G35E - AI helps automate administrative tasks: Absolutely, this is a realistic application. I would \"Strongly agree\" as this is one of the clearest benefits.\n\nTT4G35F - AI enables plagiarism/misrepresenting work: This is a concern but it's more about misuse. I would \"Agree\" that this is a risk.\n\nTT4G35G - AI makes inappropriate recommendations: This is a legitimate concern. I would \"Agree\" that this can happen.\n\nTT4G35H - AI amplifies biases: This is a known concern. I would \"Agree\" that this is a risk.\n\nTT4G35I - AI jeopardizes privacy/security: This is a legitimate concern. I would \"Agree\" that data security is a real issue.\n\nTT4G35J - AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches: This is possible. I would \"Agree\" that this could be a concern.\n\n\nI'm approaching these from a practical standpoint, recognizing both the genuine benefits AI offers in streamlining my work and personalizing instruction, while also acknowledging the real risks around academic integrity, algorithmic bias, and data protection that concern educators today.",
