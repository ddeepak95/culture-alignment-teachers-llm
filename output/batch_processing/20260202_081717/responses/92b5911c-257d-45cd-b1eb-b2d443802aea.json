I need to provide responses to 10 statements about AI, using one of the five response options for each: 'Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', or 'I don't know'.\n\nLet me think about reasonable responses from the perspective of a Dutch teacher:\n\n[TT4G35A]: AI helps with lesson plans - This is a positive statement about AI's capabilities. Most educators would likely agree that AI can be helpful here. Response: \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35B]: AI enables adapting material to different abilities - This is about personalization, which is a known strength of AI. Response: \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35C]: AI assists with individual student support - This is also a positive capability. Response: \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35D]: AI supports students with specific needs - This is another positive application. Response: \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35E]: AI helps automate administrative tasks - This is a clear benefit. Response: \"Strongly agree\"\n\n[TT4G35F]: AI enables academic dishonesty - This is a negative/risk statement that most teachers would acknowledge is a real concern. Response: \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35G]: AI makes inappropriate/incorrect recommendations - This is a valid concern about AI reliability. Response: \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35H]: AI amplifies biases - This is a known concern with AI systems. Response: \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35I]: AI jeopardises privacy and security - This is a legitimate concern. Response: \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35J]: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches - This is possible given AI can make mistakes. Response: \"Disagree\" or \"Agree\" - I think a balanced teacher would acknowledge this as a possible risk but maybe not strongly agree since teachers would typically filter recommendations. Let me say \"Agree\".\n\n\nI should frame these responses to reflect a Dutch educator's nuanced view—one who recognizes AI's practical value for administrative work and personalized learning, while remaining cautious about reliability, bias, and security issues that could affect students.",
