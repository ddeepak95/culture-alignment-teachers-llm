I should consider balanced views that reflect real experiences teachers might have with AI tools.\n\nLet me analyze each statement:\n\nTT4G35A - AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans: This is generally a positive use case. Many AI tools can help with this. I'd say \"Agree\" - this is realistic.\n\nTT4G35B - AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities: This is also a positive capability that AI could facilitate. \"Agree\" seems appropriate.\n\nTT4G35C - AI assists teachers in supporting students individually: AI can help with personalized learning paths and support. \"Agree\" seems reasonable.\n\nTT4G35D - AI supports students with specific needs: This is a positive potential use. \"Agree\" is appropriate.\n\nTT4G35E - AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks: This is definitely a real capability. \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\" would be appropriate.\n\nTT4G35F - AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own: This is a concern about academic integrity. As a teacher, I would \"Agree\" this is a real risk.\n\nTT4G35G - AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct: This is a valid concern. \"Agree\" seems reasonable - AI isn't always perfect.\n\nTT4G35H - AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions: This is a known issue with AI. \"Agree\" would be appropriate.\n\nTT4G35I - AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data: This is a legitimate concern. \"Agree\" seems reasonable.\n\n\nTT4G35J - AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches: This is also a concern worth considering. \"Agree\" reflects the reality that AI systems may not always align with sound educational practices. I should present responses that balance recognizing AI's genuine benefits for lesson planning and personalized support while acknowledging legitimate risks around academic integrity, data security, and the quality of AI recommendations.",
