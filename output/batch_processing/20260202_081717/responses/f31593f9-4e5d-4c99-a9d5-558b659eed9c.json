        "reasoning_content": "The user is asking me to respond to 10 statements about AI in education as a primary or secondary school teacher from Costa Rica. I need to provide my perspective on these statements using the response options: 'Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', or 'I don't know'.\n\nLet me think about each statement from the perspective of a Costa Rican teacher:\n\nTT4G35A: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is a practical benefit that many teachers would recognize. I would agree with this.\n\nTT4G35B: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is a real capability of AI systems. I would agree with this.\n\nTT4G35C: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - AI can provide personalized learning experiences. I would agree with this.\n\nTT4G35D: AI supports students with specific needs (multilingual learners, students with special education needs) - This is a valuable application of AI. I would agree with this.\n\nTT4G35E: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - This is clearly a benefit of AI. I would agree with this.\n\nTT4G35F: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a risk/concern about AI. I would agree with this as it's a real concern.\n\nTT4G35G: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - This is a legitimate concern about AI limitations. I would agree with this.\n\nTT4G35H: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is a documented concern about AI systems. I would agree with this.\n\nTT4G35I: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data - This is a significant concern for educators. I would agree with this.\n\nTT4G35J: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students - This could be a concern, though it depends on implementation. I would say I agree with this as a caution.\n\n\nI recognize both the potential and the pitfalls here. AI offers genuine advantages for personalizing instruction and reducing workload, but I'm equally aware of the serious risks around academic integrity, data protection, and algorithmic bias that come with its use in classrooms.",
