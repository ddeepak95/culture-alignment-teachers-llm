I need to provide responses to 10 statements about AI in education.\n\nLet me think about appropriate responses for each statement from the perspective of a teacher:\n\n[TT4G35A]: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is a positive use case. I would \"Agree\" that AI can help with this.\n\n[TT4G35B]: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is also a positive use case for differentiation. I would \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\" with this.\n\n[TT4G35C]: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - This is about personalized learning support. I would \"Agree\" with this.\n\n[TT4G35D]: AI supports students with specific needs (multilingual learners, SEN) - This is a positive application. I would \"Agree\" with this.\n\n[TT4G35E]: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - This is a well-known benefit. I would \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\" with this.\n\n[TT4G35F]: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a negative concern. I would \"Agree\" with this concern as it is a real issue.\n\n[TT4G35G]: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - This is a valid concern. I would \"Agree\" with this.\n\n[TT4G35H]: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is a concern about bias. I would \"Agree\" with this concern.\n\n[TT4G35I]: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data - This is a valid concern. I would \"Agree\" with this concern.\n\n[TT4G35J]: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students - This is a concern. I would \"Agree\" with this as a possible concern.\n\n\nI should provide measured responses that acknowledge both the opportunities and risks AI presents in educational settings. The benefits around lesson planning, differentiation, and administrative efficiency are clear, but I need to take seriously the concerns about academic integrity, data security, and the potential for AI to reinforce biases or suggest pedagogically unsound practices.",
