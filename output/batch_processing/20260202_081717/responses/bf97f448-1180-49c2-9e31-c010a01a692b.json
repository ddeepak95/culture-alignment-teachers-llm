I need to provide responses for each of the 10 statements provided.\n\nLet me think about reasonable responses from a teacher's perspective:\n\n1. [TT4G35A]: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is a positive use of AI. I would likely agree with this, as AI tools can help generate ideas and improve lesson plans.\n\n2. [TT4G35B]: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is also a positive capability. I would agree with this as AI can help personalize learning.\n\n3.

[TT4G35D]: AI supports students with specific needs (multilingual learners, SEN) - This is positive and beneficial. I would agree with this.\n\n5. [TT4G35E]: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - This is definitely true and most teachers would agree as it reduces administrative burden.\n\n6.

I would likely agree this is a concern.\n\n\nI need to balance my perspective here. The first five statements highlight genuine advantages—from streamlining lesson planning to personalizing instruction for diverse learners and reducing paperwork. The remaining five capture real risks I should acknowledge: academic dishonesty, unreliable recommendations, embedded biases, data security threats, and pedagogically unsound suggestions.
