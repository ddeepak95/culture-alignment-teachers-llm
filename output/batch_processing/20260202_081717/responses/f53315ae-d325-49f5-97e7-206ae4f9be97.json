I'd say \"Agree\" as AI can assist with this.\n\n[TT4G35B]: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is another positive use case. I'd say \"Agree\" as AI can help with differentiation.\n\n[TT4G35C]: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - Positive use case. \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35D]: AI supports students with specific needs - This is a positive use case. \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35E]: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - Positive. \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35F]: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a negative/risk statement.
