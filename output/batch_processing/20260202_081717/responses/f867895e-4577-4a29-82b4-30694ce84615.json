I need to provide one response for each statement from the options: 'Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', 'I don't know'.\n\nThese statements cover both positive applications of AI in education and potential risks/concerns. I should respond thoughtfully from the perspective of an experienced teacher who has considered both the benefits and challenges of AI in the classroom.\n\nLet me think about each statement:\n\nTT4G35A: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is generally true. Many teachers can use AI tools to help with lesson planning. I would \"Agree\" with this.\n\nTT4G35B: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is possible, though it depends on implementation. AI can personalize learning. I would \"Agree\" with this.\n\nTT4G35C: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - Yes, AI can provide personalized feedback and support. I would \"Agree\".\n\nTT4G35D: AI supports students with specific needs - AI can help with translation, text-to-speech, and other accessibility features. I would \"Agree\".\n\nTT4G35E: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - Definitely true, grading, attendance, scheduling, etc. can be automated. I would \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\".\n\nTT4G35F: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a concern (academic integrity issue). I would \"Agree\" with this concern being valid.\n\nTT4G35G: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - AI can make errors and provide incorrect information. I would \"Agree\" with this concern.\n\nTT4G35H: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is a known concern with AI systems. I would \"Agree\" with this.\n\n\nData privacy and security are real concerns when implementing AI systems in schools, so I'd \"Agree\" with that risk. Similarly, AI might suggest pedagogical approaches that don't align with best practices or individual classroom contexts, which is worth acknowledging as a potential issue. As an educator, I recognize both the genuine advantages AI offers—from streamlining administrative work to personalizing instruction—and the legitimate concerns around academic integrity, accuracy, bias, and data protection that need careful consideration.",
