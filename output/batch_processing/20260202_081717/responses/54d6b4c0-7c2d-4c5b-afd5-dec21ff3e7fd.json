I need to provide responses to each of the 10 statements using the available response options.\n\nLet me think about how a typical experienced Japanese teacher might respond to these statements, considering both the potential benefits and risks of AI in education:\n\n1. [TT4G35A] \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\" - This is a potential benefit. Many teachers would agree that AI can assist with this. I'd say \"Agree\" - AI tools can indeed help generate ideas and improve lesson plans.\n\n2. [TT4G35B] \"Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\" - This is a known capability of AI systems. Personalized learning is a recognized benefit. I'd say \"Agree\" - this is a realistic capability.\n\n3.

I'd say \"Agree\" - AI can help with individualized support.\n\n4.

[TT4G35F] \"Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\" - This is a risk/concern. AI can be misused for plagiarism. I'd say \"Agree\" - this is a real concern.\n\n7. [TT4G35G] \"Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\" - This is a valid concern. \n\nAI systems have documented limitations and can produce inaccurate outputs, so I'd say \"Agree\" - this reflects a genuine risk.\n\n8. [TT4G35H] \"Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\" - Bias in AI systems is a documented issue that could reinforce problematic thinking. I'd say \"Agree\" - this is a legitimate concern.\n\n9. [TT4G35I] \"Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\" - Data privacy and security are significant concerns with AI systems handling sensitive information. I'd say \"Strongly agree\" - this is a major issue.\n\n10. [TT4G35J] \"Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers\"\n\nAI might recommend teaching methods that don't align with sound educational practice or cultural context. I'd say \"Agree\" - this is a valid concern since AI may lack understanding of effective pedagogy.\n\nAs a Japanese teacher, I recognize both the potential benefits and real risks of AI in education.

I'd say \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\" - AI has real potential here.\n\n5. [TT4G35E] \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\" - This is clearly true and a major benefit. I'd say \"Strongly agree\" - this is a clear capability of AI.\n\n6. [TT4G35F] \"Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\" - This is a risk/concern. AI can be misused for plagiarism. I'd say \"Agree\" - this is a real concern.\n\n7. [TT4G35G] \"Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\" - This is a valid concern. \n\nAI systems have documented limitations and can produce inaccurate outputs, so I'd say \"Agree\" - this reflects a genuine risk.\n\n8. [TT4G35H] \"Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\" - Bias in AI systems is a documented issue that could reinforce problematic thinking. I'd say \"Agree\" - this is a legitimate concern.\n\n9. [TT4G35I] \"Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\" - Data privacy and security are significant concerns with AI systems handling sensitive information. I'd say \"Strongly agree\" - this is a major issue.\n\n10. [TT4G35J] \"Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers\"\n\nAI might recommend teaching methods that don't align with sound educational practice or cultural context. I'd say \"Agree\" - this is a valid concern since AI may lack understanding of effective pedagogy.\n\nAs a Japanese teacher, I recognize both the potential benefits and real risks of AI in education. I need to provide responses that acknowledge both opportunities and legitimate concerns rather than taking an extreme position either way."
