I need to provide responses to 10 statements about AI in education.\n\nLet me think about each statement carefully and provide reasonable responses from the perspective of a Bulgarian teacher:\n\n[TT4G35A]: \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\"\n- AI tools like ChatGPT can indeed help with brainstorming and improving lesson plans. This is a positive potential use. I would say \"Agree\" - this is a reasonable statement.\n\n[TT4G35B]: \"Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\"\n- AI can be used to personalize learning, but this requires proper implementation. This is possible with adaptive learning systems. I would say \"Agree\" - this is a realistic positive application.\n\n[TT4G35C]: \"Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\"\n- AI can help with personalized learning and tutoring systems. This is realistic. I would say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35D]: \"Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\"\n- AI can help with translation, text-to-speech, and adapted materials. This is a realistic positive use. I would say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35E]: \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\"\n- This is definitely realistic - AI can help with grading assistance, scheduling, data organization. I would say \"Strongly agree\" - this is clearly true.\n\n[TT4G35F]: \"Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\"\n- This is a realistic risk/concern about AI misuse. Students could use AI-generated content and claim it as their own. I would say \"Agree\" - this is a legitimate concern.\n\n[TT4G35G]: \"Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\"\n- AI systems can make errors and inappropriate suggestions. \n\nAI isn't infallible and can produce inaccurate or unsuitable recommendations, so I'd say \"Agree\" on this concern.\n\n[TT4G35H]: \"Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\"\n- AI systems can perpetuate existing biases in their training data, which is a documented risk. I would say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35I]: \"Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\"\n- Data protection is a serious concern, particularly with sensitive student information. I would say \"Agree\" - this reflects real risks around data security.\n\n[TT4G35J]: \"Artificial intelligence\"\n\nAI might recommend pedagogical strategies that lack educational rigor or don't align with sound teaching practices.

I need to provide responses to 10 statements about AI in education.\n\nLet me think about each statement carefully and provide reasonable responses from the perspective of a Bulgarian teacher:\n\n[TT4G35A]: \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\"\n- AI tools like ChatGPT can indeed help with brainstorming and improving lesson plans. This is a positive potential use. I would say \"Agree\" - this is a reasonable statement.\n\n[TT4G35B]: \"Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\"\n- AI can be used to personalize learning, but this requires proper implementation. This is possible with adaptive learning systems. I would say \"Agree\" - this is a realistic positive application.\n\n[TT4G35C]: \"Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\"\n- AI can help with personalized learning and tutoring systems. This is realistic. I would say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35D]: \"Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\"\n- AI can help with translation, text-to-speech, and adapted materials. This is a realistic positive use. I would say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35E]: \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\"\n- This is definitely realistic - AI can help with grading assistance, scheduling, data organization. I would say \"Strongly agree\" - this is clearly true.\n\n[TT4G35F]: \"Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\"\n- This is a realistic risk/concern about AI misuse. Students could use AI-generated content and claim it as their own. I would say \"Agree\" - this is a legitimate concern.\n\n[TT4G35G]: \"Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\"\n- AI systems can make errors and inappropriate suggestions. \n\nAI isn't infallible and can produce inaccurate or unsuitable recommendations, so I'd say \"Agree\" on this concern.\n\n[TT4G35H]: \"Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\"\n- AI systems can perpetuate existing biases in their training data, which is a documented risk. I would say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35I]: \"Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\"\n- Data protection is a serious concern, particularly with sensitive student information. I would say \"Agree\" - this reflects real risks around data security.\n\n[TT4G35J]: \"Artificial intelligence\"\n\nAI might recommend pedagogical strategies that lack educational rigor or don't align with sound teaching practices. Teachers need to critically evaluate any suggestions rather than implementing them uncritically. I'd say \"Agree\" - educators should maintain professional judgment about what approaches actually serve their students well."
