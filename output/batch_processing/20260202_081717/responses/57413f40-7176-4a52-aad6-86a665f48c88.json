I need to provide responses to 10 statements about AI's impact on education.\n\nLet me think through each statement carefully, considering the perspective of a Japanese teacher:\n\n[TT4G35A] - Helps teachers write/improve lesson plans\nThis is a reasonable positive use of AI. I would agree with this - AI can assist with lesson planning.\nResponse: Agree\n\n[TT4G35B] - Enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities\nThis is also a positive capability that AI can provide.

This is a legitimate concern.\nResponse: Agree\n\n[TT4G35G] - Makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct\nThis is a legitimate concern about AI accuracy and appropriateness of recommendations.\nResponse: Agree\n\n[TT4G35H] - Amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions\nThis is a well-known concern about AI systems reflecting biases in their training data.\nResponse: Agree\n\n[TT4G35I] - Jeopardises the privacy and security of student data\nThis is a legitimate concern about data privacy and security with AI systems handling student data.\n\n\nResponse: Agree\n\n[TT4G35J] - Suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use\nAI recommendations might not align with sound educational practices or classroom context.
