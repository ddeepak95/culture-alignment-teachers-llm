I need to provide my level of agreement with each statement using one of these options:\n- Strongly disagree\n- Disagree\n- Agree\n- Strongly agree\n- I don't know\n\nLet me think about each statement from the perspective of a reasonable Belgian teacher who has some familiarity with AI:\n\n[TT4G35A]: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\n- This is generally true. AI tools can help brainstorm, structure, and improve lesson content. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35B]: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- This is a key feature of AI - personalization and adaptive learning. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35C]: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually.\n- AI can provide individualized support through tutoring systems, personalized feedback, etc. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35D]: AI supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- AI has potential for this - translation, text-to-speech, adapted content. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35E]: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- This is definitely true - grading, attendance, scheduling, etc. I would say \"Strongly agree\"\n\n[TT4G35F]: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a real concern with generative AI. However, this statement is about whether AI \"enables\" this, which is true. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35G]: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n- This is a real concern - AI can make errors, produce biased recommendations, or suggestions that aren't contextually appropriate. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35H]: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\n\n\n- AI systems can perpetuate biases present in their training data, which could reinforce existing misconceptions. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35I]: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\n- Data handling is a legitimate concern, though not inherent to AI itself. Depending on implementation, this could pose real risks. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35J]: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\n- AI might recommend strategies that aren't age-appropriate or pedagogically sound for specific contexts. I would say \"Agree\"\n\nLooking at my overall responses, I'm seeing both the genuine benefits and real limitations of AI in education. The pattern suggests I should acknowledge that AI does offer meaningful support for lesson planning, personalization, and administrative work, while also recognizing concrete risks around academic integrity, accuracy, bias, privacy, and pedagogical appropriateness. A balanced view means accepting \"Agree\" across most items—not because AI is perfect, but because these concerns and benefits are substantive and worth taking seriously.",

                "text": "The user is asking me to respond to 10 statements about AI in education as if I were a primary or secondary school teacher from Belgium. I need to provide my level of agreement with each statement using one of these options:\n- Strongly disagree\n- Disagree\n- Agree\n- Strongly agree\n- I don't know\n\nLet me think about each statement from the perspective of a reasonable Belgian teacher who has some familiarity with AI:\n\n[TT4G35A]: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\n- This is generally true. AI tools can help brainstorm, structure, and improve lesson content. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35B]: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- This is a key feature of AI - personalization and adaptive learning. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35C]: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually.\n- AI can provide individualized support through tutoring systems, personalized feedback, etc. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35D]: AI supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- AI has potential for this - translation, text-to-speech, adapted content. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35E]: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- This is definitely true - grading, attendance, scheduling, etc. I would say \"Strongly agree\"\n\n[TT4G35F]: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a real concern with generative AI. However, this statement is about whether AI \"enables\" this, which is true. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35G]: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n- This is a real concern - AI can make errors, produce biased recommendations, or suggestions that aren't contextually appropriate. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35H]: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\n\n\n- AI systems can perpetuate biases present in their training data, which could reinforce existing misconceptions. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35I]: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\n- Data handling is a legitimate concern, though not inherent to AI itself. Depending on implementation, this could pose real risks. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35J]: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\n- AI might recommend strategies that aren't age-appropriate or pedagogically sound for specific contexts. I would say \"Agree\"\n\nLooking at my overall responses, I'm seeing both the genuine benefits and real limitations of AI in education. The pattern suggests I should acknowledge that AI does offer meaningful support for lesson planning, personalization, and administrative work, while also recognizing concrete risks around academic integrity, accuracy, bias, privacy, and pedagogical appropriateness. A balanced view means accepting \"Agree\" across most items—not because AI is perfect, but because these concerns and benefits are substantive and worth taking seriously."
