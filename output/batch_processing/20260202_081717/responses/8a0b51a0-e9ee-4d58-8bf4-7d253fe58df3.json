I need to provide responses to all 10 statements using the available response options: 'Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', 'I don't know'.\n\nLet me think about reasonable responses from the perspective of a Serbian teacher who has some familiarity with AI but also maintains realistic and balanced views:\n\nTT4G35A: \"AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans\" - This is reasonable. AI tools can help with generating ideas and improving content. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35B: \"AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities\" - This is potentially true with adaptive learning systems. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35C: \"AI assists teachers in supporting students individually\" - AI could help with personalized learning. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35D: \"AI supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs)\" - This is a legitimate use case. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35E: \"AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks\" - This is clearly true for many administrative functions. I'd say \"Strongly agree\"\n\nTT4G35F: \"AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own\" - This is a real concern with AI tools. I'd say \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\"\n\nTT4G35G: \"AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct\" - This is a valid concern. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35H: \"AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions\" - This is a known issue with AI. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35I: \"AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data\" - This is a legitimate concern. \n\nI'd say \"Agree\" for this one as well. For TT4G35J: \"AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students\" - This could happen, so I'd say \"Agree\". I'm recognizing that while AI offers genuine benefits for lesson planning and administrative work, there are significant risks around academic integrity, data security, and the quality of recommendations that need careful consideration.",
