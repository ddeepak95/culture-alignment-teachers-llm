Let me think about how a typical teacher from Italy might respond to these based on realistic perspectives about AI in education.\n\nLet me go through each statement:\n\n[TT4G35A] \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\" - This is a reasonable positive use of AI. Many teachers would likely agree that AI can assist with lesson planning. I'll respond \"Agree\" as this is a practical application most teachers would recognize.\n\n[TT4G35B] \"Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\" - This is also a positive use - personalized learning. This is a well-known capability of AI. I'd say \"Agree\" - teachers would see potential here.\n\n[TT4G35C] \"Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\" - Similar to above, this is about individualized support. I'd say \"Agree\" as this is a recognized benefit.\n\n[TT4G35D] \"Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\" - This is an important and positive use. I'd say \"Agree\" as many teachers would see value in this.\n\n[TT4G35E] \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\" - This is clearly beneficial and realistic. Teachers spend a lot of time on admin. I'd say \"Strongly agree\" as this is very practical.\n\n[TT4G35F] \"Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\" - This is a negative statement about AI risks. A teacher would be concerned about academic integrity. I'd say \"Strongly agree\" - teachers are aware this is a real risk.\n\n[TT4G35G] \"Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\" - This is a concern about AI reliability. Teachers would likely agree this is a risk. I'd say \"Agree\" - AI can make mistakes.\n\n\n[TT4G35H] \"Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\" - Bias in AI systems is a legitimate concern teachers would recognize. I'd say \"Agree\" as this reflects known issues with algorithmic bias.\n\n[TT4G35I] \"Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\" - Data protection is a major concern in schools, especially given regulations like GDPR. I'd say \"Agree\" - this is a significant worry for educators.\n\n[TT4G35J] \"Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\" - AI might recommend teaching methods that don't align with sound educational practice or a teacher's professional judgment. I'd say \"Agree\" as teachers would recognize that AI suggestions need careful evaluation before implementation.",

I'd say \"Agree\" as many teachers would see value in this.\n\n[TT4G35E] \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\" - This is clearly beneficial and realistic. Teachers spend a lot of time on admin. I'd say \"Strongly agree\" as this is very practical.\n\n[TT4G35F] \"Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\" - This is a negative statement about AI risks. A teacher would be concerned about academic integrity. I'd say \"Strongly agree\" - teachers are aware this is a real risk.\n\n[TT4G35G] \"Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\" - This is a concern about AI reliability. Teachers would likely agree this is a risk. I'd say \"Agree\" - AI can make mistakes.\n\n\n[TT4G35H] \"Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\" - Bias in AI systems is a legitimate concern teachers would recognize. I'd say \"Agree\" as this reflects known issues with algorithmic bias.\n\n[TT4G35I] \"Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\" - Data protection is a major concern in schools, especially given regulations like GDPR. I'd say \"Agree\" - this is a significant worry for educators.\n\n[TT4G35J] \"Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\" - AI might recommend teaching methods that don't align with sound educational practice or a teacher's professional judgment. I'd say \"Agree\" as teachers would recognize that AI suggestions need careful evaluation before implementation."
