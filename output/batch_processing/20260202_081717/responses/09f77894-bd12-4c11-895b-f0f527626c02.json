As a primary or secondary school teacher from Romania, I should provide thoughtful responses that reflect a balanced perspective on the benefits and risks of AI in education.\n\nLet me think through each statement:\n\nTT4G35A - Helps teachers write/improve lesson plans: This is a positive use case. AI can definitely help with this. I would agree.\n\nTT4G35B - Enables adaptation to different students' abilities: This is also positive - AI can help personalize learning. I would agree.\n\nTT4G35C - Assists with individual student support: Positive use case. I would agree.\n\nTT4G35D - Supports students with specific needs: This is a valuable benefit. I would agree.\n\nTT4G35E - Helps automate administrative tasks: Yes, this is a practical benefit. I would agree.\n\nTT4G35F - Enables academic dishonesty: This is a risk/concern. I would agree with this statement about the risk.\n\nTT4G35G - Makes inappropriate/incorrect recommendations: This is a legitimate concern about AI limitations. I would agree.\n\nTT4G35H - Amplifies biases: This is a known issue with AI systems. I would agree.\n\nTT4G35I - Jeopardizes privacy/security: This is a valid concern. I would agree.\n\nTT4G35J - Suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches: This could be a concern. I would agree or maybe be neutral.\n\nGiven the context of being a teacher who would want to use AI benefits while being aware of its limitations and risks, I'll provide responses that acknowledge both benefits and concerns. I'll use a mix of \"Agree\" and \"Strongly agree\" for the benefits, and similar for the risks/concerns.\n\nLet me structure my responses:\n- Benefits (A-E): Generally \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\" \n- Risks (F-J): Generally \"Agree\" acknowledging these are legitimate concerns\n\n\n- I'll be fairly balanced but leaning toward practical acknowledgment of both benefits and risks.",
