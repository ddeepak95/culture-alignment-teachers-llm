AI tools can assist with generating ideas, outlining content, and improving lesson plans.

AI can help with grading, attendance, etc. \"Strongly agree\"\n\n[TT4G35F]: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own. - This is a real concern with AI tools like ChatGPT. \"Strongly agree\" (agreeing that this is a concern)\n\n[TT4G35G]: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct. - This is a valid concern. AI systems can make errors or suggest inappropriate things. \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35H]: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions. - This is a known issue with AI systems trained on biased data. \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35I]: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data. - This is a legitimate concern about data privacy with AI systems. \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35J]: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches - This could happen depending on the AI system. \"Agree\"\n\n\nI'm thinking through how to respond to each item from my perspective as an educator.
