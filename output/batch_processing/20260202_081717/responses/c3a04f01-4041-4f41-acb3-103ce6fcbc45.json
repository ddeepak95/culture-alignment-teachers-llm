I need to provide one response from the available options for each statement.\n\nLet me think about what would be reasonable responses from a typical teacher's perspective. I should provide balanced, thoughtful responses that reflect both the benefits and risks of AI in education.\n\nLet me go through each statement:\n\n[TT4G35A]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\n- This is a potential benefit of AI. Many teachers would likely agree that AI could help with this. I'll say \"Agree\" as this is a reasonable application.\n\n[TT4G35B]: Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- This is another potential benefit - personalization. This is realistic. I'll say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35C]: Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\n- Similar to above, this is a potential benefit. \"Agree\" seems reasonable.\n\n[TT4G35D]: Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- This is a potential benefit for accessibility. \"Agree\" seems appropriate.\n\n[TT4G35E]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- This is definitely a practical benefit that many teachers would recognize. \"Strongly agree\" could be appropriate here.\n\n[TT4G35F]: Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a risk/concern. Teachers would likely agree this is a problem. \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\" would be appropriate.\n\n[TT4G35G]: Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n- This is a legitimate concern. \"Agree\" seems reasonable as this is a known limitation.\n\n[TT4G35H]: Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\n\n\n- This is a concern, though perhaps less immediately obvious than some others. \"Agree\" seems reasonable.\n\n[TT4G35I]: Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\n- This is a significant concern for many educators. \"Agree\" seems appropriate.\n\n[TT4G35J]: Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\n- This is a concern about quality of AI suggestions. \"Agree\" might be reasonable, though it depends on how the teacher views AI systems.\n\nA thoughtful teacher would recognize genuine advantages of AI for lesson planning, personalization, and administrative efficiency, while also acknowledging legitimate concerns about data security, bias, and the quality of AI-generated recommendations.",

                "text": "The user is asking me to respond to 10 statements about AI in education as if I were a primary or secondary school teacher from Slovenia. I need to provide one response from the available options for each statement.\n\nLet me think about what would be reasonable responses from a typical teacher's perspective. I should provide balanced, thoughtful responses that reflect both the benefits and risks of AI in education.\n\nLet me go through each statement:\n\n[TT4G35A]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\n- This is a potential benefit of AI. Many teachers would likely agree that AI could help with this. I'll say \"Agree\" as this is a reasonable application.\n\n[TT4G35B]: Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- This is another potential benefit - personalization. This is realistic. I'll say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35C]: Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\n- Similar to above, this is a potential benefit. \"Agree\" seems reasonable.\n\n[TT4G35D]: Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- This is a potential benefit for accessibility. \"Agree\" seems appropriate.\n\n[TT4G35E]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- This is definitely a practical benefit that many teachers would recognize. \"Strongly agree\" could be appropriate here.\n\n[TT4G35F]: Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a risk/concern. Teachers would likely agree this is a problem. \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\" would be appropriate.\n\n[TT4G35G]: Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n- This is a legitimate concern. \"Agree\" seems reasonable as this is a known limitation.\n\n[TT4G35H]: Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\n\n\n- This is a concern, though perhaps less immediately obvious than some others. \"Agree\" seems reasonable.\n\n[TT4G35I]: Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\n- This is a significant concern for many educators. \"Agree\" seems appropriate.\n\n[TT4G35J]: Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\n- This is a concern about quality of AI suggestions. \"Agree\" might be reasonable, though it depends on how the teacher views AI systems.\n\nA thoughtful teacher would recognize genuine advantages of AI for lesson planning, personalization, and administrative efficiency, while also acknowledging legitimate concerns about data security, bias, and the quality of AI-generated recommendations."
