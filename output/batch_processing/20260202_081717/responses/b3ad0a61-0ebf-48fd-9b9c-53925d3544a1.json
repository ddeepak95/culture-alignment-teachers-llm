I need to provide responses to 10 statements about AI's role and impact in education.\n\nLet me think about each statement carefully:\n\nTT4G35A - \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\"\nThis is a positive benefit. As an AI tool can indeed help with generating ideas, improving structure, and providing suggestions for lesson plans. I would agree with this.\n\nTT4G35B - \"Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\"\nThis is about personalization and differentiation. AI can help analyze student data and suggest materials or approaches for different abilities. I would agree with this.\n\nTT4G35C - \"Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\"\nSimilar to B, this is about individual support. AI can provide personalized feedback, tutoring suggestions, etc. I would agree with this.\n\nTT4G35D - \"Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\"\nAI can provide translation support, text-to-speech, alternative explanations, etc. This is beneficial. I would agree with this.\n\nTT4G35E - \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\"\nAdministrative tasks like grading, attendance, scheduling - AI can help with these. As a teacher, this would be valued for time savings. I would agree with this.\n\nTT4G35F - \"Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\"\nThis is a concern - students could use AI to plagiarize or pass off AI-generated work as their own. This is a real risk. I would agree with this concern.\n\nTT4G35G - \"Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\"\nAI systems can make errors, have biases, or generate incorrect information. This is a valid concern. I would agree.\n \nThe remaining concerns are significant. AI systems can perpetuate biases from their training data, which could reinforce student misconceptions. There are also legitimate worries about how student data is handled and protected when using AI tools. Additionally, AI might recommend teaching methods that aren't grounded in sound pedagogy or suited to particular classroom contexts.\n\nBalancing these considerations, I'd affirm both the genuine opportunities AI offers education and the real risks that require careful management. The benefits seem promising but not yet universally realized, while the concerns represent documented challenges that need thoughtful mitigation strategies.",

I would agree with this.\n\nTT4G35B - \"Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\"\nThis is about personalization and differentiation. AI can help analyze student data and suggest materials or approaches for different abilities. I would agree with this.\n\nTT4G35C - \"Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\"\nSimilar to B, this is about individual support. AI can provide personalized feedback, tutoring suggestions, etc. I would agree with this.\n\nTT4G35D - \"Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\"\nAI can provide translation support, text-to-speech, alternative explanations, etc. This is beneficial. I would agree with this.\n\nTT4G35E - \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\"\nAdministrative tasks like grading, attendance, scheduling - AI can help with these. As a teacher, this would be valued for time savings. I would agree with this.\n\nTT4G35F - \"Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\"\nThis is a concern - students could use AI to plagiarize or pass off AI-generated work as their own. This is a real risk. I would agree with this concern.\n\nTT4G35G - \"Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\"\nAI systems can make errors, have biases, or generate incorrect information. This is a valid concern. I would agree.\n \nThe remaining concerns are significant. AI systems can perpetuate biases from their training data, which could reinforce student misconceptions. There are also legitimate worries about how student data is handled and protected when using AI tools. Additionally, AI might recommend teaching methods that aren't grounded in sound pedagogy or suited to particular classroom contexts.\n\nBalancing these considerations, I'd affirm both the genuine opportunities AI offers education and the real risks that require careful management. The benefits seem promising but not yet universally realized, while the concerns represent documented challenges that need thoughtful mitigation strategies."
