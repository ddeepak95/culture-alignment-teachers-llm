I should provide thoughtful responses based on a realistic teacher perspective.\n\nLet me consider each statement:\n\n[TT4G35A]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\n- This is a positive application. I would agree with this as AI tools can help generate ideas and structure for lesson plans.\n\n[TT4G35B]: Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- This is a positive capability. I would agree - AI can help with personalization and differentiation.\n\n[TT4G35C]: Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\n- Another positive application. I would agree that AI can help with individual support.\n\n[TT4G35D]: Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- This is positive and important. I would agree strongly with this as it's an important equity consideration.\n\n[TT4G35E]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- This is clearly a positive use. I would agree or strongly agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35F]: Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a concern/negative. I would agree that this is a real issue.\n\n[TT4G35G]: Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n- This is a legitimate concern. I would agree with this as AI can make mistakes.\n\n[TT4G35H]: Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\n- This is a concern about bias. I would agree this is a potential issue.\n\n[TT4G35I]: Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\n- This is a concern about data protection. I would agree this is a potential risk.\n\n[TT4G35J]: Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\n\n\n- This concerns me as well, since AI might not always understand the nuances of effective teaching in my classroom context. I recognize both the genuine advantages AI offers—from streamlining administrative work to personalizing instruction for diverse learners—and the real risks it poses around data security, bias, and pedagogical misalignment. My responses will reflect this balanced perspective.",
