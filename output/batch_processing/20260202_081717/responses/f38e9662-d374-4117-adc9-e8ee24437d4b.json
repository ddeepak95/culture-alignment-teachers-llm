I need to provide responses to 10 statements about AI in education, rating my agreement level from the options: 'Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', 'I don't know'.\n\nLet me think about each statement from the perspective of a teacher who has experience with AI in education:\n\n[TT4G35A]: \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\"\n- This is a positive application. AI tools can indeed help with lesson planning by suggesting structures, examples, etc. I would say I \"Agree\" with this.\n\n[TT4G35B]: \"Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\"\n- AI can analyze student performance and suggest adaptations. This is a valid use case. I would say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35C]: \"Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\"\n- AI can provide personalized learning paths and feedback. This is a known capability. I would say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35D]: \"Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\"\n- AI can help with text-to-speech, translation, personalized learning for special needs. This is reasonable.

I would say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35F]: \"Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\"\n- This is a real concern with AI tools like ChatGPT. Students can use AI to generate work and submit it as their own. This is a valid concern. I would say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35G]: \"Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\"\n\n\n- AI systems can produce errors or unsuitable suggestions, which is a known limitation.

AI tools can indeed help with lesson planning by suggesting structures, examples, etc. I would say I \"Agree\" with this.\n\n[TT4G35B]: \"Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\"\n- AI can analyze student performance and suggest adaptations. This is a valid use case. I would say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35C]: \"Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\"\n- AI can provide personalized learning paths and feedback. This is a known capability. I would say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35D]: \"Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\"\n- AI can help with text-to-speech, translation, personalized learning for special needs. This is reasonable. I would say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35E]: \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\"\n- This is a practical benefit - grading, attendance tracking, organizing data. I would say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35F]: \"Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\"\n- This is a real concern with AI tools like ChatGPT. Students can use AI to generate work and submit it as their own. This is a valid concern. I would say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35G]: \"Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\"\n\n\n- AI systems can produce errors or unsuitable suggestions, which is a known limitation. I would say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35H]: \"Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\"\n- Training data often contains biases that AI systems can perpetuate. I would say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35I]: \"Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\"\n- Storing and processing student information through AI systems presents real risks. I would say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35J]: \"Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\"\n- AI may recommend teaching methods that don't align with sound educational practice or classroom context. I would say \"Agree\".\n\nI'm balancing recognition of AI's educational benefits with awareness of genuine concerns. As an educator, I see value in both the opportunities and the need to remain cautious about implementation."
