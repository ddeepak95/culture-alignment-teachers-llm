I need to provide responses to 10 statements about AI in education.\n\nLet me think about how a typical French teacher might respond to these statements based on realistic perspectives:\n\n1. [TT4G35A] - AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans: This is generally a positive application of AI. Most teachers would likely agree this is possible. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\n2. [TT4G35B] - AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities: This is also a beneficial application. \"Agree\"\n\n3. [TT4G35C] - AI assists teachers in supporting students individually: Similar to above, this is a positive application. \"Agree\"\n\n4. [TT4G35D] - AI supports students with specific needs: This is a positive application for accessibility and inclusion. \"Agree\"\n\n5. [TT4G35E] - AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks: This is a well-recognized benefit. \"Agree\"\n\n6. [TT4G35F] - AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own: This is a concern/risk. A teacher would likely agree this is a problem. \"Agree\" (acknowledging this as a real concern)\n\n7. [TT4G35G] - AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct: This is a valid concern about AI reliability. \"Agree\"\n\n8. [TT4G35H] - AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions: This is a concern about bias in AI. \"Agree\"\n\n9. [TT4G35I] - AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data: This is a valid concern in France, especially given GDPR and data protection concerns. \"Agree\"\n\n10. [TT4G35J] - AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches: This is a concern about the quality of pedagogical recommendations. \"Agree\"\n\n\nMy responses show a pragmatic stance that recognizes both the genuine advantages AI offers—from streamlining lesson preparation to personalizing instruction—and the legitimate risks teachers face, particularly around data protection, algorithmic bias, and academic integrity. This reflects how a French educator might weigh the potential benefits against real concerns about implementation and safeguards.",
