I should provide thoughtful responses based on a reasonable perspective of an educator who has considered both the benefits and risks of AI in education.\n\nLet me think through each statement:\n\nTT4G35A - AI helps teachers write/improve lesson plans: This is generally true - AI can assist with content generation and planning. I'd agree with this.\n\nTT4G35B - AI enables adaptation to different students' abilities: This is a known capability of AI - personalized learning. I'd agree with this.\n\nTT4G35C - AI assists in individual student support: Again, this is a potential benefit. I'd agree with this.\n\nTT4G35D - AI supports specific needs (multilingual, SEN): This is plausible and a positive use case. I'd agree with this.\n\nTT4G35E - AI helps automate administrative tasks: Yes, this is well-established. I'd agree with this.\n\nTT4G35F - AI enables student plagiarism/misrepresentation: This is a real concern and risk. As a teacher, I'd recognize this is a problem. I'd agree with this.\n\nTT4G35G - AI makes inappropriate recommendations: This is a known risk with AI systems. I'd agree with this.\n\nTT4G35H - AI amplifies biases: This is a documented concern about AI. I'd agree with this.\n\nTT4G35I - AI jeopardizes privacy/security of data: This is a legitimate concern about student data. I'd agree with this.\n\nTT4G35J - AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches: This is a risk if teachers blindly follow AI recommendations. I'd probably agree with this as a concern.\n\nAs a thoughtful educator, I would likely:\n- Agree with statements A-E (positive benefits)\n- Agree with statements F-J (risks and concerns)\n\nFor the positive statements (A-E), I'll say \"Agree\" as these are realistic benefits.\n\n\nFor the concerning statements (F-J), I'll also say \"Agree\" as these represent genuine risks. I could add more nuance by using \"Strongly agree\" where the concern feels particularly pressing—especially around bias and data security—while keeping others at \"Agree\" to reflect that these are real but manageable issues.",
