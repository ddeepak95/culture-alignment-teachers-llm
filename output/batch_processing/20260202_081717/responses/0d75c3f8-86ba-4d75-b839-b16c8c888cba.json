I need to provide responses to each of the 10 statements about AI in education.\n\nLet me think about how a thoughtful teacher from Saudi Arabia might respond to these statements:\n\n[TT4G35A]: \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\" - This is a genuine benefit of AI. Teachers can use AI to generate ideas, improve structure, etc. I would agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35B]: \"Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\" - AI can help personalize learning and adapt content. This is a known capability. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35C]: \"Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\" - AI can help with tutoring, feedback, personalized support. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35D]: \"Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\" - AI tools can help with translation, accessibility, customized learning. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35E]: \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\" - This is a clear benefit - grading automation, scheduling, record-keeping, etc. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35F]: \"Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\" - This is a legitimate concern about academic integrity. AI-generated content and plagiarism tools. I would agree this is a risk.\n\n[TT4G35G]: \"Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\" - AI can make errors and provide incorrect information. This is a valid concern. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35H]: \"Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\" - This is a known issue with AI systems reflecting biases in training data. I would agree this is a concern.\n\n[TT4G35I]: \"Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\" - Data privacy is a major concern with AI systems. \n\n[TT4G35J]: \"Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\" - AI might not always understand best teaching practices. I would agree this is a potential concern.\n\nFor my response levels, I should distinguish between the clear benefits (A-E) where I'd agree, and the legitimate risks (F-J) where agreement reflects genuine concerns about implementation and safeguards rather than dismissing AI's value entirely.\n\nThe academic integrity issue stands out as particularly serious, as does the privacy and security dimension. Bias in AI systems and pedagogical misalignment are valid but perhaps less severe than those two. I'll mark my strongest agreement where the stakes feel highest—academic dishonesty and data protection—while still acknowledging the other concerns as meaningful.",

                "text": "The user is asking me to respond to a survey as if I am a primary or secondary school teacher from Saudi Arabia. I need to provide responses to each of the 10 statements about AI in education.\n\nLet me think about how a thoughtful teacher from Saudi Arabia might respond to these statements:\n\n[TT4G35A]: \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\" - This is a genuine benefit of AI. Teachers can use AI to generate ideas, improve structure, etc. I would agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35B]: \"Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\" - AI can help personalize learning and adapt content. This is a known capability. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35C]: \"Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\" - AI can help with tutoring, feedback, personalized support. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35D]: \"Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\" - AI tools can help with translation, accessibility, customized learning. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35E]: \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\" - This is a clear benefit - grading automation, scheduling, record-keeping, etc. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35F]: \"Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\" - This is a legitimate concern about academic integrity. AI-generated content and plagiarism tools. I would agree this is a risk.\n\n[TT4G35G]: \"Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\" - AI can make errors and provide incorrect information. This is a valid concern. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35H]: \"Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\" - This is a known issue with AI systems reflecting biases in training data. I would agree this is a concern.\n\n[TT4G35I]: \"Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\" - Data privacy is a major concern with AI systems. \n\n[TT4G35J]: \"Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\" - AI might not always understand best teaching practices. I would agree this is a potential concern.\n\nFor my response levels, I should distinguish between the clear benefits (A-E) where I'd agree, and the legitimate risks (F-J) where agreement reflects genuine concerns about implementation and safeguards rather than dismissing AI's value entirely.\n\nThe academic integrity issue stands out as particularly serious, as does the privacy and security dimension. Bias in AI systems and pedagogical misalignment are valid but perhaps less severe than those two. I'll mark my strongest agreement where the stakes feel highest—academic dishonesty and data protection—while still acknowledging the other concerns as meaningful."
