I need to provide one response for each statement from the options: 'Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', 'I don't know'.\n\nLet me think about each statement from a Finnish teacher's perspective:\n\n[TT4G35A]: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is generally true. AI tools can assist with lesson planning. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35B]: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is a potential benefit of AI. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35C]: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - This is possible with AI personalization tools. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35D]: AI supports students with specific needs - This can be helpful for accessibility and personalization. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35E]: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - This is clearly a benefit. I would say \"Strongly agree\"\n\n[TT4G35F]: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a concern with AI (plagiarism, academic integrity). As a teacher, I would acknowledge this concern. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35G]: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - This is a valid concern about AI reliability. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35H]: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is a known concern about AI bias. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35I]: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data - This is a concern with data handling. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35J]: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches - This could happen if AI doesn't understand pedagogical best practices. \n\nFor the final statement, I'd also say \"Agree\" since AI systems may not always align with established educational methods. I'm balancing the genuine advantages AI offers—like automating grading and personalizing instruction—against legitimate risks around data security, algorithmic bias, and academic integrity that concern educators.",
