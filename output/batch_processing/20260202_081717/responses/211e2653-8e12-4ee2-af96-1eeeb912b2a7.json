I'm asked to assume I'm a primary or secondary school teacher from Serbia responding to a survey. I should provide thoughtful, balanced responses that reflect the perspective of an educator considering both the benefits and risks of AI in education.\n\nLet me think about each statement:\n\n[TT4G35A]: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is generally true. AI can help generate ideas and improve lesson plans. I would agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35B]: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is also true. AI can personalize learning and adapt content. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35C]: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - Yes, AI can help provide personalized support. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35D]: AI supports students with specific needs - Yes, AI can help with accessibility for multilingual learners and those with special needs. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35E]: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - Yes, definitely. This is a clear benefit. I would strongly agree.\n\n[TT4G35F]: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a risk/concern statement. Yes, AI tools can facilitate plagiarism and academic dishonesty. I would agree with this concern.\n\n[TT4G35G]: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - This is true, AI can make errors. I would agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35H]: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is a valid concern about biases in AI. I would agree with this concern.\n\n[TT4G35I]: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data - This is a valid concern. Data privacy is important. I would agree with this concern.\n\n[TT4G35J]: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches - This is possible, as AI might not always understand best pedagogical practices. \n\nI would agree with this concern. My responses should reflect a balanced perspective—acknowledging the genuine advantages AI offers for lesson planning, personalization, and administrative efficiency, while also recognizing legitimate concerns around academic integrity, data security, algorithmic bias, and pedagogical appropriateness. I'm an educator who recognizes AI's potential but remains cautious about its limitations.",
