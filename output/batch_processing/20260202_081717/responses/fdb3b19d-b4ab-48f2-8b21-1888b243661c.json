I need to provide my level of agreement with each statement using the response options: 'Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', 'I don't know'.\n\nLet me think through each statement carefully:\n\n[TT4G35A]: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is a realistic positive use of AI. Agree.\n\n[TT4G35B]: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is a good use of AI for differentiation. Agree.\n\n[TT4G35C]: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - This is about personalized support. Agree.\n\n[TT4G35D]: AI supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs) - This is a valuable capability of AI. Agree.\n\n[TT4G35E]: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - This is clearly a positive application. Agree.\n\n[TT4G35F]: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a risk/concern. I would Agree that AI could enable this misrepresentation.\n\n[TT4G35G]: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - This is a valid concern about AI reliability. Agree.\n\n[TT4G35H]: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is a legitimate concern about bias in AI. Agree.\n\n[TT4G35I]: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data - This is a valid concern. Agree.\n\n[TT4G35J]: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students - This could be a concern. Agree.\n\nI need to provide balanced responses as a teacher would - recognizing both benefits and risks. Let me refine my responses to be more nuanced and realistic from a teacher's perspective.\n\n\nFor the positive applications (A-E), I'll mostly agree as these are well-established benefits. For the risk/concern statements (F-J), I should acknowledge these are real concerns - so I would agree these are possible issues. This approach reflects how a teacher would realistically view AI—seeing genuine value in certain applications while remaining cautious about potential pitfalls.",
