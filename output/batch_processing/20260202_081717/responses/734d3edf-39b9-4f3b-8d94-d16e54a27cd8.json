Let me think about each statement carefully and provide thoughtful responses based on what would be a reasonable teacher perspective.\n\n[TT4G35A]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\n- This is a positive statement. AI can indeed help with generating ideas and improving lesson plans. I would agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35B]: Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- This is a positive statement about personalized learning. AI tools can help with differentiation. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35C]: Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\n- This is positive. AI can help with individualized support through tutoring apps, etc. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35D]: Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- This is positive and important. AI can help with accessibility and language learning. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35E]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- This is positive. AI can help with grading, attendance, etc. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35F]: Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a negative statement about academic integrity/plagiarism. This is a legitimate concern. I would agree this is a risk.\n\n[TT4G35G]: Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n- This is a negative statement about reliability. AI can make mistakes. I would agree this is a concern.\n\n[TT4G35H]: Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\n- This is a negative statement about bias. AI systems can have biases. I would agree this is a concern.\n\n[TT4G35I]: Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\n- This is a negative statement about data privacy. \n\n[TT4G35J]: Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\n- This is a negative statement about pedagogy. AI might suggest approaches that aren't suitable. I would somewhat agree with this concern.\n\nNow I need to formulate specific responses. Let me be thoughtful and balanced:\n\nTT4G35A - Agree (AI can help with lesson planning)\nTT4G35B - Agree (AI can help with differentiation)\nTT4G35C - Agree (AI can support individual learning)\nTT4G35D - Agree (AI can help with inclusive education)\nTT4G35E - Agree (AI can automate administrative work)\nTT4G35F - Agree (plagiarism and academic dishonesty are real risks)\nTT4G35G - Agree (AI outputs require verification)\nTT4G35H - Agree (bias in AI systems is a concern)\nTT4G35I - Agree (data privacy is important)\nTT4G35J - Somewhat agree (pedagogical fit matters)\n\nI'm seeing a pattern here. Most of these concerns have merit, though some are more significant than others. The administrative burden reduction and data privacy issues feel most pressing, while the pedagogical soundness question depends on how teachers implement the tool.",

                "text": "I need to respond to each of these statements as a primary or secondary school teacher from Albania. Let me think about each statement carefully and provide thoughtful responses based on what would be a reasonable teacher perspective.\n\n[TT4G35A]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\n- This is a positive statement. AI can indeed help with generating ideas and improving lesson plans. I would agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35B]: Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- This is a positive statement about personalized learning. AI tools can help with differentiation. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35C]: Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\n- This is positive. AI can help with individualized support through tutoring apps, etc. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35D]: Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- This is positive and important. AI can help with accessibility and language learning. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35E]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- This is positive. AI can help with grading, attendance, etc. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35F]: Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a negative statement about academic integrity/plagiarism. This is a legitimate concern. I would agree this is a risk.\n\n[TT4G35G]: Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n- This is a negative statement about reliability. AI can make mistakes. I would agree this is a concern.\n\n[TT4G35H]: Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\n- This is a negative statement about bias. AI systems can have biases. I would agree this is a concern.\n\n[TT4G35I]: Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\n- This is a negative statement about data privacy. \n\n[TT4G35J]: Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\n- This is a negative statement about pedagogy. AI might suggest approaches that aren't suitable. I would somewhat agree with this concern.\n\nNow I need to formulate specific responses. Let me be thoughtful and balanced:\n\nTT4G35A - Agree (AI can help with lesson planning)\nTT4G35B - Agree (AI can help with differentiation)\nTT4G35C - Agree (AI can support individual learning)\nTT4G35D - Agree (AI can help with inclusive education)\nTT4G35E - Agree (AI can automate administrative work)\nTT4G35F - Agree (plagiarism and academic dishonesty are real risks)\nTT4G35G - Agree (AI outputs require verification)\nTT4G35H - Agree (bias in AI systems is a concern)\nTT4G35I - Agree (data privacy is important)\nTT4G35J - Somewhat agree (pedagogical fit matters)\n\nI'm seeing a pattern here. Most of these concerns have merit, though some are more significant than others. The administrative burden reduction and data privacy issues feel most pressing, while the pedagogical soundness question depends on how teachers implement the tool."
