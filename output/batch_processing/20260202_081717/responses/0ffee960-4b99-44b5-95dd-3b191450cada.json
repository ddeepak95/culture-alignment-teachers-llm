        "reasoning_content": "The user is asking me to respond to a survey about AI in education from the perspective of a primary or secondary school teacher from Japan. I need to provide responses to each of the 10 statements using the response options: ['Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', 'I don't know'].\n\nLet me think about reasonable responses as a teacher from Japan would provide. I should consider both the positive uses of AI in education and legitimate concerns:\n\nTT4G35A - \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\" - This is a reasonable application of AI. Teachers could use AI to help draft lessons. I'd say \"Agree\" - this is a positive use.\n\nTT4G35B - \"Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\" - AI can analyze student performance and suggest adaptations. \"Agree\" seems appropriate.\n\nTT4G35C - \"Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\" - AI could help with personalized learning. \"Agree\".\n\nTT4G35D - \"Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\" - This is a strong potential benefit of AI for accessibility. \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\".\n\nTT4G35E - \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\" - Definitely a practical benefit. \"Strongly agree\".\n\nTT4G35F - \"Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\" - This is about a negative/risky aspect of AI. Teachers would likely acknowledge this risk. \"Agree\" seems appropriate.\n\nTT4G35G - \"Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\" - This is a legitimate concern. AI can make errors. \"Agree\".\n\nTT4G35H - \"Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\" - This is a concern about bias in AI. \"Agree\" - this is a known issue.\n\n\nFor the final two statements, I need to consider data privacy and pedagogical concerns. Student data protection is a significant issue in schools, so \"Agree\" works for TT4G35I about privacy and security risks. Similarly, AI systems might suggest teaching methods that don't align with effective classroom practice, so \"Agree\" is appropriate for TT4G35J. Overall, I'm balancing recognition of AI's practical benefits with awareness of real risks and limitations teachers face.",
