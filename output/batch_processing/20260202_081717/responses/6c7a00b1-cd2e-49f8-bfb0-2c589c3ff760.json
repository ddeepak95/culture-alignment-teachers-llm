I need to provide responses to each of the 10 statements using the available response options: 'Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', 'I don't know'.\n\nLet me think about reasonable responses from the perspective of a teacher in Shanghai:\n\n1. [TT4G35A]: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is generally true and many teachers have experienced benefits from AI tools. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n2. [TT4G35B]: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is a capability AI has shown, though implementation varies. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n3. [TT4G35C]: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - This is a potential benefit, though direct evidence varies. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n4. [TT4G35D]: AI supports students with specific needs - This has strong potential for multilingual learners and those with special needs. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n5. [TT4G35E]: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - This is clearly true and widely experienced. I would say \"Strongly agree\"\n\n6. [TT4G35F]: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a genuine concern/risk. I would say \"Agree\" (acknowledging it's a real concern)\n\n7. [TT4G35G]: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - This is definitely true, AI can make mistakes. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n8. [TT4G35H]: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is a valid concern, though not always the case. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n9. [TT4G35I]: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data - This is a legitimate concern with data handling. \n\nFor the final two items, I recognize that data privacy represents a real risk in educational settings, so I'd respond \"Agree\" there. Regarding pedagogical approaches, AI systems may indeed suggest methods that don't align with effective teaching practices depending on how they're configured, so that would also be \"Agree\". Now I'll submit these responses using the json_tool_call function.",
