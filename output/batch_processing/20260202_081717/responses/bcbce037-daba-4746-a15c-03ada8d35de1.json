        "reasoning_content": "I need to respond to 10 statements about AI in education as a French primary or secondary school teacher. Let me think through each statement carefully and provide thoughtful responses based on what a realistic teacher perspective might be.\n\nLet me go through each:\n\n[TT4G35A]: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - I would agree with this. AI tools can definitely assist in brainstorming and refining lesson plans.\n\n[TT4G35B]: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - I would agree. AI can provide personalized learning paths and adapt content based on student performance.\n\n[TT4G35C]: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - I would agree. AI can provide individual feedback and support.\n\n[TT4G35D]: AI supports students with specific needs - I would agree. AI can help with multilingual support, dyslexia assistance, etc.\n\n[TT4G35E]: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - I would agree. This is clear - grading, attendance, record-keeping can be automated.\n\n[TT4G35F]: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - I would agree with this. This is a real concern with AI tools like ChatGPT.\n\n[TT4G35G]: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - I would agree. AI can make mistakes and hallucinate information.\n\n[TT4G35H]: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - I would agree with this concern. AI models can perpetuate biases in training data.\n\n[TT4G35I]: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data - I would agree. This is a legitimate concern with data collection and storage.\n\n[TT4G35J]: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use - I would agree with this. AI might suggest approaches that aren't suitable for particular contexts or student populations.\n\nFor a balanced French teacher perspective, I think most of these warrant agreement or strong agreement for the positive aspects (A-E) and for the risk/concern aspects (F-J), as a responsible educator would be aware of these risks.",
