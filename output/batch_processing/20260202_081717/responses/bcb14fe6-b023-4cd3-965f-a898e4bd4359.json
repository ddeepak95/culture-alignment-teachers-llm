I need to provide responses to all 10 statements using the response options: 'Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', 'I don't know'.\n\nLet me think about reasonable responses from a Finnish teacher's perspective. Finland has a strong education system and tends to be thoughtful about technology adoption. I should consider:\n\n1. TT4G35A - AI helping with lesson plans: This is a positive use. A teacher would likely agree that AI can assist with this.\n\n2. TT4G35B - AI adapting material to different abilities: This is a potential benefit. Agree seems reasonable.\n\n3. TT4G35C - AI assisting with individual student support: Another positive potential. Agree seems reasonable.\n\n4. TT4G35D - AI supporting specific needs: This could be very helpful for accessibility. Agree seems reasonable.\n\n5. TT4G35E - AI automating administrative tasks: Teachers often welcome help with admin. Agree seems reasonable.\n\n6. TT4G35F - AI enabling plagiarism/misrepresentation: This is a concern. A teacher would likely agree that this is a risk.\n\n7. TT4G35G - AI making inappropriate recommendations: This is a valid concern. Agree seems reasonable.\n\n8. TT4G35H - AI amplifying biases: This is an important concern. Agree seems reasonable.\n\n9. TT4G35I - AI jeopardizing privacy/security: This is a significant concern for educators. Agree seems reasonable.\n\n10. TT4G35J - AI suggesting unsuitable pedagogy: This is a concern.
