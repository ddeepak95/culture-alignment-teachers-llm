This is a real problem that teachers face.\nResponse: **Agree**\n\n[TT4G35G]: Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n- This is true. AI systems can make errors or provide inappropriate suggestions. This is a known limitation.\nResponse: **Agree**\n \n[TT4G35H]: Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\n- AI systems can perpetuate biases present in their training data, which is a legitimate concern in educational contexts.\nResponse: **Agree**\n\n[TT4G35I]: Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\n- Storing or processing student information through AI systems does raise significant data protection concerns.\nResponse: **Agree**\n\n[TT4G35J]: Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\n- AI could recommend teaching methods that aren't appropriate for specific classroom contexts or student populations.\nResponse: **Agree**\n\nApproaching this from a practical teacher's perspective, the positive applications (A-E) represent genuine opportunities I'd recognize in my classroom, while the risks outlined (F-J) reflect real challenges educators encounter when implementing AI tools. These responses feel grounded in actual classroom experience."
