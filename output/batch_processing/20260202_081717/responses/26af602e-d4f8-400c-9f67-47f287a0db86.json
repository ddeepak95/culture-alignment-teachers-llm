As a primary or secondary school teacher from Latvia, I should provide thoughtful responses based on my perspective.\n\nLet me think through each statement:\n\n[TT4G35A]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\n- This is a positive use case. AI tools like ChatGPT can help generate ideas, improve wording, provide structure. I would Agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35B]: Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- AI can help personalize content through adaptive learning systems. I would Agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35C]: Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\n- AI can provide personalized feedback, tutoring support. I would Agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35D]: Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- AI has potential here with translation tools, text-to-speech, etc. I would Agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35E]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- Yes, AI can help with grading, attendance, scheduling. I would Strongly agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35F]: Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a risk - students could use AI to generate work and claim it as their own. I would Agree with this concern.\n\n[TT4G35G]: Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n- Yes, AI systems can make errors, hallucinate, or provide incorrect information. I would Agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35H]: Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\n- This is a known issue with AI training data. I would Agree with this concern.\n\n[TT4G35I]: Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\n\n\n- Student data protection is critical, and this represents a genuine risk when using AI systems. I would Agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35J]: Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\n- Teachers might apply AI recommendations without proper critical evaluation or pedagogical grounding. I would Agree with this concern.\n\nNow I'll formulate my responses as a Latvian teacher, considering both the genuine benefits and legitimate risks these tools present.",
