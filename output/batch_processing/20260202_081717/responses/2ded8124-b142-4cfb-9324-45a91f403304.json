I'll say \"Agree\" as this is a reasonable use case.\n\n[TT4G35B]: Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- This is also a positive and realistic capability of AI.

I'll say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35D]: Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- This is a particularly valuable application. AI could help with language support and accessibility. I'll say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35E]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- This is a clear and well-established benefit. Most teachers would appreciate automation of administrative tasks. I'll say \"Strongly agree\".\n\n[TT4G35F]: Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a concern about academic integrity. As a teacher, I would acknowledge this is a real risk. I'll say \"Agree\" - this is a genuine concern.\n\n[TT4G35G]: Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n- This is a valid concern about AI accuracy and reliability. \n\nI'll say \"Agree\" - this is a reasonable acknowledgment of limitations.\n\n[TT4G35H]: Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\n- This is a concern about bias in AI systems. This is a documented issue. I'll say \"Agree\" as this is a real concern.\n\n[TT4G35I]: Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\n- This is a concern about data protection. Given GDPR and other regulations in Austria/EU, this would be a significant concern. I'll say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35J]: Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students\n- AI systems might recommend teaching methods that don't align with established educational practices or classroom context. I'll say \"Agree\" as this is a plausible limitation.\n\nI want to present a balanced view here - recognizing genuine risks while acknowledging that AI can offer value in educational settings when implemented thoughtfully."
