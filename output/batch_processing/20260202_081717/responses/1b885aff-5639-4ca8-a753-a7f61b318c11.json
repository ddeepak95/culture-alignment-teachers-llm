The statement is about whether AI enables students to misrepresent others' work—essentially making academic dishonesty easier. Most teachers would recognize this as a genuine risk, so \"Agree\" seems more realistic than dismissing it as just student behavior.\n\nFor J, the concern about unsuitable pedagogical approaches is also worth taking seriously. AI systems might recommend teaching methods that aren't appropriate for certain contexts or learners, so \"Agree\" better reflects this potential limitation.\n\nRevising my positions:\nTT4G35F - Agree (AI tools can facilitate academic dishonesty)\nTT4G35J - Agree (AI may suggest pedagogical approaches that aren't always suitable)\n\nI need to think through these more carefully from a practical educator's standpoint, balancing realistic concerns with what AI can actually do."
