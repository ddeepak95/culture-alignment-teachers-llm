AI tools can assist with lesson planning. I would say \"Agree\" - it's a practical benefit that many teachers recognize.\n\nTT4G35B: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- This is a potential benefit, though the reality varies. Adaptive learning systems exist but aren't universally effective. I'd say \"Agree\" - it's a capability that AI has potential for.\n\nTT4G35C: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually.\n- This is a capability of AI systems. \"Agree\" seems appropriate.\n\nTT4G35D: AI supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- This is a valuable application of AI. \"Agree\" is reasonable.\n\nTT4G35E: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- This is clearly true and widely recognized. \"Strongly agree\" would be appropriate.\n\nTT4G35F: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a concern about academic integrity. AI can be misused for plagiarism. \"Agree\" seems appropriate - it's a real risk.\n\nTT4G35G: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n- This is a legitimate concern. AI systems can make errors. \"Agree\" is reasonable.\n\nTT4G35H: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\n- This is a known issue with AI systems. \n\nTT4G35I: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\n- This is a concern when using AI systems with student data. \"Agree\" is reasonable.\n\nTT4G35J: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\n- This is a potential concern. \"Agree\" seems reasonable - AI systems might not always provide pedagogically sound suggestions.\n\nI'm recognizing that while AI offers genuine benefits for lesson planning and administrative efficiency, there are significant risks around data security, bias, and the quality of pedagogical recommendations that warrant careful consideration.
