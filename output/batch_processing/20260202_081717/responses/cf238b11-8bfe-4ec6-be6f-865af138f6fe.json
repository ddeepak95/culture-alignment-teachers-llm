I need to provide responses to 10 statements about AI in education.\n\nLet me think about reasonable responses from an Icelandic teacher's perspective:\n\n1. TT4G35A - \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\" - This is generally true, many teachers find AI tools helpful for this. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\n2. TT4G35B - \"Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\" - This is a positive potential use of AI. \"Agree\"\n\n3. TT4G35C - \"Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\" - Yes, AI can help with personalized learning. \"Agree\"\n\n4. TT4G35D - \"Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs\" - AI has good potential here. \"Agree\"\n\n5. TT4G35E - \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\" - This is true and widely recognized. \"Strongly agree\"\n\n6. TT4G35F - \"Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\" - This is a concern about academic integrity. As a teacher, I'd recognize this as a real risk. \"Strongly agree\"\n\n7. TT4G35G - \"Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\" - This is a valid concern. \"Agree\"\n\n8. TT4G35H - \"Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\" - This is a known concern with AI systems. \"Agree\"\n\n9. TT4G35I - \"Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\" - This is a valid concern. \"Agree\"\n\n10. TT4G35J - \"Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\" - This is a concern but might be less common. \"Disagree\" or \"Agree\"? I think this would be \"Agree\" as a concern.\n\n\nI should aim for responses that acknowledge both the genuine advantages AI offers—like streamlining administrative work and personalizing instruction—while also recognizing legitimate risks around academic integrity, data security, and the potential for AI systems to produce flawed or biased recommendations.",
