I need to provide a response for each statement using one of the five options: 'Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', or 'I don't know'.\n\nLet me think about reasonable responses from a teacher's perspective:\n\n1. **TT4G35A**: \"AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans\" - This is generally a positive statement about AI's potential. Many teachers would agree with this as AI tools can assist with lesson planning. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\n2. **TT4G35B**: \"AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities\" - This is another positive capability. AI can help with differentiation. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\n3. **TT4G35C**: \"AI assists teachers in supporting students individually\" - This speaks to personalized learning support. Reasonable agreement. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\n4. **TT4G35D**: \"AI supports students with specific needs\" - This is about accessibility and support for special needs. Positive statement. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\n5. **TT4G35E**: \"AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks\" - This is a practical benefit many teachers would recognize. I'd say \"Strongly agree\"\n\n6. **TT4G35F**: \"AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own\" - This is about academic dishonesty/plagiarism. Teachers would be concerned about this. I'd say \"Agree\" (acknowledging this is a real concern/risk)\n\n7. **TT4G35G**: \"AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct\" - This is a valid concern about AI reliability. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\n8. **TT4G35H**: \"AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions\" - This is a concern about bias in AI. Reasonable concern. \n\nFor the remaining statements, I recognize concerns about data protection, unsuitable pedagogical suggestions, and bias amplification as legitimate issues teachers face when implementing AI tools in classrooms. These represent real risks alongside the genuine benefits AI offers for lesson planning, differentiation, and administrative efficiency.",
