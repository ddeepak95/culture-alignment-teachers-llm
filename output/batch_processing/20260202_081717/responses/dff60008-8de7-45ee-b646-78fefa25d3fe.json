The responses should reflect a reasonable perspective from such a teacher about the use of AI in education.\n\nLet me think about each statement:\n\n[TT4G35A] - AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is a positive application. Many teachers have found AI useful for this. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35B] - AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is also a positive application. AI can help personalize content. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35C] - AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - Positive application. AI can provide personalized support. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35D] - AI supports students with specific needs - Positive application. AI can help with accessibility and support for multilingual learners and students with special needs. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35E] - AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - This is widely recognized as a positive use case. I would say \"Strongly agree\"\n\n[TT4G35F] - AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a negative statement about academic integrity. As a teacher, I would be concerned about this. I would say \"Agree\" (acknowledging this is a real risk)\n\n[TT4G35G] - AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - This is also a concern. AI can make errors. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35H] - AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is a concern about bias in AI. I would say \"Agree\" (as this is a known risk)\n\n\nRegarding data protection, I'm concerned about privacy and security risks when using AI systems with student information, so I'd say \"Agree\" for that statement. As for pedagogical approaches, AI recommendations are generally sound even if imperfect, so I'd lean toward \"Disagree\" on that concern.",
