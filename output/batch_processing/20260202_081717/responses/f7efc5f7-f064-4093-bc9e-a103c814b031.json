I need to provide responses to each of the 10 statements about AI in education.\n\nAs a teacher from Brazil responding to this survey, I should think about what would be reasonable responses based on practical experience and awareness of both benefits and risks of AI in education.\n\nLet me consider each statement:\n\n[TT4G35A]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\n- This is a reasonable use case. AI can indeed help with lesson planning. I would agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35B]: Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- This is also a strong use case for AI - personalization. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35C]: Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\n- Individual student support is something AI can help with. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35D]: Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- AI has potential here too for accessibility and support. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35E]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- This is clearly a practical benefit. I would strongly agree.\n\n[TT4G35F]: Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is about academic dishonesty/plagiarism risks. I would agree this is a concern.\n\n[TT4G35G]: Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n- This is a legitimate concern about AI reliability. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35H]: Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\n- This is a known concern with AI systems. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35I]: Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\n- This is a legitimate concern about data protection. I would agree.\n  \n[TT4G35J]: Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\n- AI systems might recommend teaching methods that don't fit our educational context or student needs.
