I need to provide responses for each of the 10 statements using the available response options: 'Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', 'I don't know'.\n\nLet me think through each statement and provide balanced, thoughtful responses that represent a teacher's perspective:\n\nTT4G35A: \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\"\n- This is generally a positive and realistic use case. Many teachers would agree that AI can help with this task. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35B: \"Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\"\n- This is a realistic benefit of AI in education.
