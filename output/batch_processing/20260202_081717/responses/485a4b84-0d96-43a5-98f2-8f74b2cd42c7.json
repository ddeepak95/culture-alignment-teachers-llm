I need to provide my responses to each of the 10 statements about AI.\n\nLet me think about reasonable responses from a teacher's perspective:\n\nTT4G35A: \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\" - This is generally true, AI tools can help with generating or improving lesson plans. I would say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35B: \"Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\" - AI can help personalize learning, so this is positive. I would say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35C: \"Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\" - Similar to above, AI can help with personalized support. I would say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35D: \"Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\" - AI has potential to support diverse learners. I would say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35E: \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\" - This is definitely true, AI can help automate grading, scheduling, etc. I would say \"Strongly agree\"\n\nTT4G35F: \"Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\" - This is a risk with AI, students could use it to plagiarize. As a concerned teacher, I would say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35G: \"Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\" - This is a valid concern, AI can make errors or inappropriate suggestions. I would say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35H: \"Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\" - This is a known issue with AI, biases in training data. I would say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35I: \"Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\" - This is a concern with data collection and storage. \n\nFor the final two statements, I'm concerned about data privacy risks and pedagogical appropriateness. AI systems may suggest teaching methods that don't fit my classroom context or students' needs. I'd mark both as areas of concern—\"Agree\" for the privacy issue and \"Strongly agree\" for unsuitable pedagogical approaches, since I need to maintain professional judgment about what works for my students.",
