I need to provide responses to 10 statements about AI in education.\n\nLet me think about reasonable responses from the perspective of a teacher who has some familiarity with AI but is also realistic about both its benefits and risks:\n\n1. TT4G35A - \"AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans\" - I would agree with this. AI tools can help with brainstorming and drafting lesson plans. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\n2. TT4G35B - \"AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities\" - This is a reasonable capability of AI tools. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\n3. TT4G35C - \"AI assists teachers in supporting students individually\" - AI could help with personalized learning, though there are limitations. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\n4. TT4G35D - \"AI supports students with specific needs\" - AI has potential for accessibility features and personalized support. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\n5.

TT4G35F - \"AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own\" - This is a real concern with AI. A teacher would likely agree with this negative statement. I'll say \"Strongly agree\"\n\n7. TT4G35G - \"AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct\" - This is a valid concern. AI can make errors. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\n8. TT4G35H - \"AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions\" - This is a known risk with AI. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\n9. TT4G35I - \"AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data\" - This is a legitimate concern about data collection and storage. \n\n10. TT4G35J - \"AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students\" - AI might not always suggest pedagogically sound approaches.
