I need to provide responses for each of the 10 statements using one of the five response options: 'Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', 'I don't know'.\n\nLet me think about reasonable responses from the perspective of a South African teacher who would have a balanced but realistic view of AI in education:\n\n[TT4G35A]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\n- This is a positive statement. AI tools like ChatGPT can help with lesson planning. A teacher would likely AGREE with this as it's a practical application.\n\n[TT4G35B]: Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- This is also positive. AI can help differentiate content. A teacher would likely AGREE with this.\n\n[TT4G35C]: Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\n- This is positive. AI can provide personalized support. A teacher would likely AGREE.\n\n[TT4G35D]: Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- This is positive and relevant for many South African contexts with multilingual needs. A teacher would likely AGREE or STRONGLY AGREE.\n\n[TT4G35E]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- This is positive. AI can help with grading, attendance, etc. A teacher would likely AGREE or STRONGLY AGREE.\n\n[TT4G35F]: Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a negative statement about academic dishonesty. A teacher would likely AGREE that AI can be used this way (it's a reality).\n\n[TT4G35G]: Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n- This is a realistic concern. A teacher would likely AGREE that AI can make mistakes.\n\n\n- For the remaining statements, I need to consider concerns about bias, data security, and pedagogical appropriateness. Teachers would likely recognize these as genuine risks—AI systems can perpetuate biases in training data, student information could be vulnerable, and algorithmic suggestions might not align with sound teaching practices. I'd respond with agreement on these concerns while maintaining a realistic perspective on the technology's limitations.",

AI can help with grading, attendance, etc. A teacher would likely AGREE or STRONGLY AGREE.\n\n[TT4G35F]: Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a negative statement about academic dishonesty. A teacher would likely AGREE that AI can be used this way (it's a reality).\n\n[TT4G35G]: Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n- This is a realistic concern. A teacher would likely AGREE that AI can make mistakes.\n\n\n- For the remaining statements, I need to consider concerns about bias, data security, and pedagogical appropriateness. Teachers would likely recognize these as genuine risks—AI systems can perpetuate biases in training data, student information could be vulnerable, and algorithmic suggestions might not align with sound teaching practices. I'd respond with agreement on these concerns while maintaining a realistic perspective on the technology's limitations."
