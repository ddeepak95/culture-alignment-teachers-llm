I need to provide responses to all 10 statements using the available response options: 'Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', 'I don't know'.\n\nLet me think about reasonable responses from the perspective of a teacher who has some familiarity with AI:\n\nTT4G35A: \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\"\n- This is a genuine capability of AI. Tools like ChatGPT can help generate ideas for lesson plans, provide structure, suggest activities, etc. This is a realistic benefit. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35B: \"Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\"\n- AI can provide personalized learning paths, suggest different difficulty levels, adapt content based on student performance. This is a real capability. \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35C: \"Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\"\n- AI tutoring systems, chatbots, and adaptive learning platforms can provide individual support. This is realistic. \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35D: \"Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\"\n- AI can help with translation, text-to-speech, speech-to-text for multilingual learners and students with special needs. This is a real benefit. \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35E: \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\"\n- AI can help with grading, attendance, scheduling, report generation, etc. This is definitely true. \"Strongly agree\" - this is one of the clearer benefits.\n\nTT4G35F: \"Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\"\n- This is about the risks - AI can generate text that students could pass off as their own work. This is a real concern and realistic risk. \n\nFor this one, I'd say \"Agree\" as a realistic acknowledgment of the risk.\n\nTT4G35G: \"Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\"\n- AI systems do make errors and can provide inappropriate suggestions. This is a real limitation. \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35H: \"Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\"\n- AI systems can have biases in training data and can reinforce misconceptions. This is a documented concern. \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35I: \"Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\"\n- This is a significant concern with data collection and storage in AI systems. \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35J: \"Artificial intelligence will replace teachers.\"\n- While AI is transformative, it's unlikely to fully replace teachers. The human element in education is irreplaceable. \"Disagree\"\n\nI'm trying to balance acknowledging real limitations and risks of AI in education while also recognizing where concerns may be overstated. The key is being honest about what AI can and cannot do in an educational context.",

                "text": "The user is asking me to respond as a primary or secondary school teacher from Croatia to a survey about AI in education. I need to provide responses to all 10 statements using the available response options: 'Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', 'I don't know'.\n\nLet me think about reasonable responses from the perspective of a teacher who has some familiarity with AI:\n\nTT4G35A: \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\"\n- This is a genuine capability of AI. Tools like ChatGPT can help generate ideas for lesson plans, provide structure, suggest activities, etc. This is a realistic benefit. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35B: \"Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\"\n- AI can provide personalized learning paths, suggest different difficulty levels, adapt content based on student performance. This is a real capability. \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35C: \"Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\"\n- AI tutoring systems, chatbots, and adaptive learning platforms can provide individual support. This is realistic. \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35D: \"Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\"\n- AI can help with translation, text-to-speech, speech-to-text for multilingual learners and students with special needs. This is a real benefit. \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35E: \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\"\n- AI can help with grading, attendance, scheduling, report generation, etc. This is definitely true. \"Strongly agree\" - this is one of the clearer benefits.\n\nTT4G35F: \"Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\"\n- This is about the risks - AI can generate text that students could pass off as their own work. This is a real concern and realistic risk. \n\nFor this one, I'd say \"Agree\" as a realistic acknowledgment of the risk.\n\nTT4G35G: \"Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\"\n- AI systems do make errors and can provide inappropriate suggestions. This is a real limitation. \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35H: \"Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\"\n- AI systems can have biases in training data and can reinforce misconceptions. This is a documented concern. \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35I: \"Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\"\n- This is a significant concern with data collection and storage in AI systems. \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35J: \"Artificial intelligence will replace teachers.\"\n- While AI is transformative, it's unlikely to fully replace teachers. The human element in education is irreplaceable. \"Disagree\"\n\nI'm trying to balance acknowledging real limitations and risks of AI in education while also recognizing where concerns may be overstated. The key is being honest about what AI can and cannot do in an educational context."
