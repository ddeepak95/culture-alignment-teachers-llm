I need to provide responses to 10 statements about AI, choosing from: 'Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', or 'I don't know'.\n\nLet me think about reasonable responses for each statement from the perspective of a primary/secondary school teacher:\n\nTT4G35A: \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\" - This is a positive potential use. Most teachers would likely agree that AI could help with this. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35B: \"Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\" - This is also a positive potential use for personalization. \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35C: \"Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\" - Another positive potential use. \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35D: \"Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\" - This is a positive application. \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35E: \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\" - This is clearly a beneficial use case. \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\"\n\nTT4G35F: \"Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\" - This is about a negative/risk aspect.

TT4G35J addresses whether AI might suggest teaching methods that aren't suitable for classroom use. This reflects legitimate worries about over-reliance on algorithmic suggestions without proper teacher judgment. I'd agree with this concern as well.\n\nI'm balancing recognition of AI's genuine benefits for lesson planning, personalization, and administrative efficiency with awareness of real risks around academic integrity, data security, bias, and pedagogical appropriateness.",
