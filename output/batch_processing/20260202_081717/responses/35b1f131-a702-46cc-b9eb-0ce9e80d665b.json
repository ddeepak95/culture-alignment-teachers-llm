Let me think through each one based on my perspective as an educator:\n\n[TT4G35A]: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - I would agree with this. AI tools can help generate ideas and improve lesson content.\n\n[TT4G35B]: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - I would agree. Adaptive learning systems can personalize content.\n\n[TT4G35C]: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - I would agree with this as well. AI can provide personalized support.\n\n[TT4G35D]: AI supports students with specific needs - I would agree. AI tools can be beneficial for multilingual learners and students with special needs.\n\n[TT4G35E]: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - I would strongly agree. This is a clear benefit that can free up teacher time.\n\n[TT4G35F]: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is about academic dishonesty/plagiarism. I would agree with this as a concern, as this is a real risk with AI tools like text generation.\n\n[TT4G35G]: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - I would agree. AI can make mistakes and errors.\n\n[TT4G35H]: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - I would agree with this as a concern. AI systems can perpetuate biases.\n\n[TT4G35I]: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data - I would agree with this concern. Data privacy is a real issue with AI systems.\n\n[TT4G35J]: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students - I would agree with this as a potential concern. AI might not always understand the best teaching methods for all contexts.\n\nLet me provide balanced responses that acknowledge both the benefits and risks of AI in education:",
