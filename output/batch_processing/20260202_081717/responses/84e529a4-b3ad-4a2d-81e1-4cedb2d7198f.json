I need to provide responses to each of the 10 statements about AI in education.\n\nLet me think about how a teacher from Türkiye might respond to these statements based on balanced perspectives about AI in education:\n\n1. TT4G35A - AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans: This is generally a positive use case. Most teachers would likely agree with this. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\n2. TT4G35B - AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities: This is also a positive capability. Personalized learning is a known benefit of AI. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\n3. TT4G35C - AI assists teachers in supporting students individually: This is about individual support. Again positive. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\n4. TT4G35D - AI supports students with specific needs: This is a specific and important use case for accessibility. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\n5. TT4G35E - AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks: This is clearly beneficial. I'd say \"Strongly agree\"\n\n6. TT4G35F - AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own: This is a risk/concern. This is about plagiarism and academic integrity. A teacher would likely agree this is a concern. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\n7. TT4G35G - AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct: This is a valid concern about AI reliability. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\n8. TT4G35H - AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions: This is about bias in AI systems. This is a known concern. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\n9. TT4G35I - AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data: This is a real concern about data privacy. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\n10. TT4G35J - AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches: This is about potential misuse or inappropriate suggestions from AI. \n\nI'd say \"Agree\" as well. My responses should reflect both the genuine advantages AI offers—like automating grading and tailoring content to individual learners—and the legitimate concerns around academic integrity, data security, and algorithmic bias that any educator would reasonably have.",
