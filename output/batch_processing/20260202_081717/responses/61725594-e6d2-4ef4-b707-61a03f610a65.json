I need to provide responses to 10 statements about AI's impact on education.\n\nLet me think about what a typical Japanese teacher might respond to these statements, considering both positive applications and legitimate concerns about AI in education:\n\n[TT4G35A]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\n- This is a beneficial application. I would say \"Agree\" - AI can definitely help with lesson planning.\n\n[TT4G35B]: Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- This is about personalization/differentiation. I would say \"Agree\" - AI can help with this.\n\n[TT4G35C]: Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\n- This is about individual student support. I would say \"Agree\" - AI can provide personalized support.\n\n[TT4G35D]: Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- This is about accessibility and inclusion. I would say \"Agree\" - AI can be beneficial here.\n\n[TT4G35E]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- This is about reducing workload on teachers. I would say \"Strongly agree\" - this is a clear benefit to reduce teacher burden.\n\n[TT4G35F]: Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a negative aspect - academic dishonesty.
