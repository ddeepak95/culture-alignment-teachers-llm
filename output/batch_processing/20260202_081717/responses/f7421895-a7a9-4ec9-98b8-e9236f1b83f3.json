AI tools can assist with brainstorming and drafting lesson plans. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35B: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is a reasonable capability of AI.

I'd say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35D: AI supports students with specific needs (multilingual learners, SEN) - AI has potential here but also limitations. I'd say \"Agree\" as it's developing in this area.\n\nTT4G35E: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - This is clearly true. I'd say \"Strongly agree\"\n\nTT4G35F: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a risk/concern with AI.

I'd say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35H: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is a known concern with AI. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35I: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data - This is a valid concern. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35J: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches - This is possible but depends on how AI is trained/designed. \n\nFor the last statement, I'd say \"Agree\" as a measured response to this potential risk.
