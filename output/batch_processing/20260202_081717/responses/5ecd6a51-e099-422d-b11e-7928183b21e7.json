I should provide thoughtful, balanced responses that reflect a realistic teacher's perspective on AI in education.\n\nLet me think through each statement:\n\nTT4G35A: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is generally positive and realistic. I would \"Agree\" with this as AI tools can indeed help with lesson planning.\n\nTT4G35B: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is a benefit of AI, though it requires proper implementation. I would \"Agree\" with this.\n\nTT4G35C: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - This is true; AI can help with personalized learning. I would \"Agree\".\n\nTT4G35D: AI supports students with specific needs - This is a genuine benefit, especially for multilingual learners or those with special needs. I would \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\". Let me say \"Agree\" to be realistic about current capabilities.\n\nTT4G35E: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - This is definitely true and is one of the biggest benefits. I would \"Strongly agree\".\n\nTT4G35F: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a real concern, but it's more about how AI is misused. A realistic teacher would \"Agree\" that this is a concern.\n\nTT4G35G: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - This is a valid concern. Teachers know that AI can make errors. I would \"Agree\".\n\nTT4G35H: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is a known issue with AI. I would \"Agree\".\n\nTT4G35I: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data - This is a legitimate concern. I would \"Agree\" as this is a real issue to consider.\n\nTT4G35J: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches - This could happen if AI training data doesn't reflect best practices. \n\nFor this last one, I'd \"Agree\" as well, since AI systems might recommend methods that don't align with effective teaching practices or the specific context of my classroom. I should present responses that acknowledge both the genuine advantages AI offers—like streamlining administrative work and personalizing instruction—while recognizing legitimate risks around data security, accuracy, and potential misuse by students.",
