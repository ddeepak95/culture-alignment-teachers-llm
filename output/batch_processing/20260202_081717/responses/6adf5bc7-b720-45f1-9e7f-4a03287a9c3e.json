I need to provide responses for each of the 10 statements using the available response options: 'Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', 'I don't know'.\n\nLet me think through each statement from the perspective of a thoughtful school teacher:\n\n[TT4G35A] - AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans. This is a reasonable benefit that many would see as helpful. I'd say \"Agree\" - it's a real capability but not necessarily transformative.\n\n[TT4G35B] - AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities. This is a useful potential of AI for differentiation. I'd say \"Agree\" - this is a real capability.\n\n[TT4G35C] - AI assists teachers in supporting students individually. Similar to above, this has potential. I'd say \"Agree\" - AI can help with individualized support.\n\n[TT4G35D] - AI supports students with specific needs (multilingual, special education needs). This is a good use case. I'd say \"Agree\" - there are real applications here.\n\n[TT4G35E] - AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks. This is clearly a real benefit many teachers would welcome. I'd say \"Strongly agree\" - this is widely recognized and beneficial.\n\n[TT4G35F] - AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own. This is a real concern with generative AI. I'd say \"Agree\" - this is a genuine risk.\n\n[TT4G35G] - AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct. This is a real concern about AI reliability. I'd say \"Agree\" - AI systems do make errors.\n\n[TT4G35H] - AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions. This is a known issue with AI. \n\nResearch demonstrates that AI systems can indeed amplify existing biases, so I'd say \"Agree\" here.\n\n[TT4G35I] - AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data. This is a significant concern. I'd say \"Agree\" - data security is a real concern with AI systems.\n\n[TT4G35J] - AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students. This is plausible but perhaps less certain. I'd say \"Disagree\" - teachers generally have pedagogical judgment and would filter inappropriate suggestions.\n\nLet me reconsider these responses to make them thoughtful and balanced as a teacher would be.",
