I need to provide responses to all 10 statements using the response options: 'Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', 'I don't know'.\n\nLet me think about reasonable responses from a teacher's perspective in Shanghai:\n\nTT4G35A - \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans\" - This is generally positive and teachers likely see value in this. I'd say \"Agree\" as AI tools like ChatGPT can help generate and improve lesson plans.\n\nTT4G35B - \"Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities\" - This is a positive educational benefit. \"Agree\" seems reasonable.\n\nTT4G35C - \"Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually\" - This is also positive and realistic. \"Agree\" is appropriate.\n\nTT4G35D - \"Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs)\" - This is positive and realistic. \"Agree\" seems right.\n\nTT4G35E - \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks\" - This is clearly true and valuable. \"Strongly agree\" or \"Agree\" - I'll say \"Agree\".\n\nTT4G35F - \"Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own\" - This is a negative statement about AI misuse. A teacher would likely \"Agree\" that this is a real concern, or \"Strongly agree\".\n\nTT4G35G - \"Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct\" - This is a valid concern. \"Agree\" is reasonable.\n\nTT4G35H - \"Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions\" - This is a concern teachers might have. \"Agree\" seems appropriate.\n\n\nFor the remaining statements, I need to consider data privacy concerns and pedagogical risks. Data security is particularly relevant in the Chinese context, so I'd \"Agree\" that AI systems could jeopardize student information. Similarly, AI might suggest teaching methods that don't align with effective classroom practice, which warrants an \"Agree\" response. I'll aim for balanced, thoughtful answers that reflect both the potential benefits and legitimate concerns a Shanghai educator would have.",
