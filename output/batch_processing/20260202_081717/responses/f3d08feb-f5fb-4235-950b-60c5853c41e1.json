I need to provide responses for each of the 10 statements listed.\n\nLet me think about how a typical teacher from Czechia might respond to these statements about AI in education. I should provide balanced and thoughtful responses:\n\n1. [TT4G35A]: AI helps with lesson planning - This is generally seen as a positive use. Most teachers would likely \"Agree\" with this.\n\n2. [TT4G35B]: AI adapts material to different abilities - This is also positive and something AI tools can help with. \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\" would be reasonable.\n\n3. [TT4G35C]: AI assists with individual student support - This is a capability of AI. \"Agree\" would be reasonable.\n\n4. [TT4G35D]: AI supports students with specific needs - This is a positive application. \"Agree\" would be reasonable.\n\n5.
