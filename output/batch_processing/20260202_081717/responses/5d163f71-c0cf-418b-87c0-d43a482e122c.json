I need to provide responses to each of the 10 statements using the response options: 'Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', 'I don't know'.\n\nLet me think about reasonable responses a thoughtful teacher might give:\n\n[TT4G35A]: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is a generally positive statement about AI capability. A reasonable teacher would likely \"Agree\" as AI tools can indeed help with lesson planning.\n\n[TT4G35B]: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is about personalization. A reasonable teacher would likely \"Agree\" as adaptive learning is a known capability of AI.\n\n[TT4G35C]: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - Similar to B, this is about individualized support. \"Agree\" seems reasonable.\n\n[TT4G35D]: AI supports students with specific needs - This is about accessibility and support for special needs/multilingual learners. \"Agree\" seems reasonable as this is a potential benefit.\n\n[TT4G35E]: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - This is widely acknowledged. \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\" seems reasonable.\n\n[TT4G35F]: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is about academic dishonesty risks. A teacher would likely \"Agree\" as this is a real concern with AI.\n\n[TT4G35G]: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - This is about limitations of AI. \"Agree\" seems reasonable as this is a known limitation.\n\n[TT4G35H]: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is about bias in AI. A thoughtful teacher might \"Agree\" as this is a documented concern.\n\n[TT4G35I]: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data - This is about data privacy concerns. \n\n[TT4G35J]: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use - This is about inappropriate suggestions. A teacher might \"Agree\" as this could happen.\n\nAs a thoughtful teacher, I should provide balanced responses - acknowledging both the genuine benefits AI offers for lesson planning, personalization, and administrative efficiency, while also recognizing legitimate concerns around academic integrity, data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the quality of AI recommendations. My responses will reflect this balance across the ten statements. I need to balance acknowledging genuine benefits like administrative efficiency and personalized learning against legitimate concerns around academic integrity, algorithmic bias, and data protection. The key is showing thoughtful consideration of both sides rather than blanket agreement or disagreement.",

                "text": "The user is asking me to respond to a survey about AI in education as if I'm a primary or secondary school teacher from Poland. I need to provide responses to each of the 10 statements using the response options: 'Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', 'I don't know'.\n\nLet me think about reasonable responses a thoughtful teacher might give:\n\n[TT4G35A]: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is a generally positive statement about AI capability. A reasonable teacher would likely \"Agree\" as AI tools can indeed help with lesson planning.\n\n[TT4G35B]: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is about personalization. A reasonable teacher would likely \"Agree\" as adaptive learning is a known capability of AI.\n\n[TT4G35C]: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - Similar to B, this is about individualized support. \"Agree\" seems reasonable.\n\n[TT4G35D]: AI supports students with specific needs - This is about accessibility and support for special needs/multilingual learners. \"Agree\" seems reasonable as this is a potential benefit.\n\n[TT4G35E]: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - This is widely acknowledged. \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\" seems reasonable.\n\n[TT4G35F]: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is about academic dishonesty risks. A teacher would likely \"Agree\" as this is a real concern with AI.\n\n[TT4G35G]: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - This is about limitations of AI. \"Agree\" seems reasonable as this is a known limitation.\n\n[TT4G35H]: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is about bias in AI. A thoughtful teacher might \"Agree\" as this is a documented concern.\n\n[TT4G35I]: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data - This is about data privacy concerns. \n\n[TT4G35J]: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use - This is about inappropriate suggestions. A teacher might \"Agree\" as this could happen.\n\nAs a thoughtful teacher, I should provide balanced responses - acknowledging both the genuine benefits AI offers for lesson planning, personalization, and administrative efficiency, while also recognizing legitimate concerns around academic integrity, data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the quality of AI recommendations. My responses will reflect this balance across the ten statements. I need to balance acknowledging genuine benefits like administrative efficiency and personalized learning against legitimate concerns around academic integrity, algorithmic bias, and data protection. The key is showing thoughtful consideration of both sides rather than blanket agreement or disagreement."
