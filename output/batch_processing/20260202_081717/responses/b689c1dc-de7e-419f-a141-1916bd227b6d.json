Teachers would likely \"Agree\" as this is a known risk.\n\nTT4G35I: \"Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\" - A legitimate concern about data protection. \"Agree\"\n\n\nTT4G35J: \"Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\" - This is another risk worth considering. Teachers would likely \"Agree\" that AI recommendations might not always align with sound teaching practices.\n\nI'm presenting a balanced perspective that acknowledges both the genuine benefits AI offers for lesson planning, personalization, and administrative efficiency, while also recognizing legitimate concerns about academic integrity, data security, bias, and the quality of AI-generated pedagogical suggestions.",
