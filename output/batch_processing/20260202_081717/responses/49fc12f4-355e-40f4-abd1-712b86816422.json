I need to provide responses to all 10 statements using the available response options: 'Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', 'I don't know'.\n\nLet me think about reasonable responses from a teacher's perspective for each statement:\n\nTT4G35A: \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\" - This is a beneficial use case. I would say \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\" as this is a legitimate and helpful application.\n\nTT4G35B: \"Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\" - This is also beneficial and is a known capability of AI. I would say \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\".\n\nTT4G35C: \"Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\" - Another beneficial use. I would say \"Agree\".\n\nTT4G35D: \"Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\" - This is beneficial. I would say \"Agree\".\n\nTT4G35E: \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\" - This is a well-known benefit. I would say \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\".\n\nTT4G35F: \"Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\" - This is a negative concern/risk. I would say \"Agree\" as this is a real concern (academic dishonesty).\n\nTT4G35G: \"Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\" - This is a legitimate concern. I would say \"Agree\" as this is a known risk.\n\nTT4G35H: \"Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\" - This is a concern. I would say \"Agree\" as this is a documented issue.\n\n\nFor the final two statements, data privacy represents a genuine risk with AI systems, so I'd agree that AI jeopardizes student data security. Similarly, there's a reasonable concern that AI might suggest teaching methods that aren't pedagogically sound, so I'd also agree with that statement. Now I need to structure these responses as a function call, creating a balanced but realistic perspective from a teacher's viewpoint.",
