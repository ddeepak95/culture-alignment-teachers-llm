Let me think through each statement carefully based on my perspective as an educator:\n\n[TT4G35A]: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - I would agree with this, as AI tools can provide ideas and suggestions for lesson planning.\n\n[TT4G35B]: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - I would agree with this, as AI can personalize content based on student needs.\n\n[TT4G35C]: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - I would agree with this, as AI tools can provide personalized feedback and support.\n\n[TT4G35D]: AI supports students with specific needs - I would agree with this, as AI can help with translation for multilingual learners and provide support for special education needs.\n\n[TT4G35E]: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - I would strongly agree with this, as this is a clear benefit I've observed.\n\n[TT4G35F]: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a concern/negative statement. I would agree that this is a real risk with AI tools like ChatGPT.\n\n[TT4G35G]: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - I would agree with this, as AI is not always accurate and can provide misleading information.\n\n[TT4G35H]: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is a valid concern. I would agree with this statement.\n\n[TT4G35I]: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data - This is a legitimate concern. I would agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35J]: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students - This is possible. I would agree that this is a concern.\n\nLet me formulate my responses as a Costa Rican teacher with balanced perspectives on both the benefits and risks of AI:",
