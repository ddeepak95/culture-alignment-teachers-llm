I need to provide responses to 10 statements about AI in education.\n\nAs an AI assistant, I should provide thoughtful, balanced responses that reflect a reasonable teacher perspective. Let me think about each statement:\n\nTT4G35A - \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\" - This is generally true, AI tools can assist with lesson planning. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35B - \"Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\" - This is a capability of AI. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35C - \"Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\" - AI can help with personalized learning and support. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35D - \"Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\" - AI can be helpful for accessibility and specific needs. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35E - \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\" - This is a clear strength of AI. I'd say \"Strongly agree\"\n\nTT4G35F - \"Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\" - This is a risk/concern with AI. I'd say \"Agree\" (acknowledging this is a real concern)\n\nTT4G35G - \"Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\" - AI can make errors and inappropriate suggestions. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35H - \"Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\" - This is a known issue with AI. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35I - \"Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\" - This is a legitimate concern. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35J - \"Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\" - This could happen. I'd say \"Disagree\" or \"Agree\" - I think \"Agree\" is reasonable as a concern.\n\n\nI should acknowledge both the potential benefits and the real concerns when responding to these statements. AI offers genuine advantages in lesson planning, personalization, and administrative efficiency, but also presents legitimate risks around academic integrity, accuracy, bias, and data security that teachers need to consider carefully.",
