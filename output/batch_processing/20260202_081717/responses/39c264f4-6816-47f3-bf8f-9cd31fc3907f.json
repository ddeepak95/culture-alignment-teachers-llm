I need to provide responses to each of the 10 statements.\n\nLet me think about reasonable responses from a teacher's perspective:\n\n1. [TT4G35A]: \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\" - This is a reasonable capability of AI. Many teachers would agree with this. I'd say \"Agree\" as this is a practical benefit.\n\n2. [TT4G35B]: \"Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\" - This is also a reasonable capability. AI can help personalize learning. I'd say \"Agree\".\n\n3. [TT4G35C]: \"Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\" - Similar to above, reasonable. I'd say \"Agree\".\n\n4. [TT4G35D]: \"Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\" - This is a potential benefit. I'd say \"Agree\".\n\n5. [TT4G35E]: \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\" - This is definitely realistic. I'd say \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\".\n\n6. [TT4G35F]: \"Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\" - This is about academic dishonesty. Teachers would likely see this as a real concern. I'd say \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\".\n\n7. [TT4G35G]: \"Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\" - This is a valid concern. AI can make mistakes. I'd say \"Agree\".\n\n8. [TT4G35H]: \"Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\" - This is a concern but maybe not universal. I'd say \"Agree\" as it's a known issue.\n\n9. [TT4G35I]: \"Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\" - This is a real concern for many teachers. \n\nFor the final statement about unsuitable pedagogical approaches, that's a plausible risk though perhaps less prominent than other concerns. I want to construct responses that balance recognition of AI's genuine educational benefits with legitimate worries about misuse, bias, and data protection.",
