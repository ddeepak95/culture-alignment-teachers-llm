I need to provide responses to 10 statements about AI in education.\n\nLet me think about reasonable responses from a teacher's perspective:\n\n1. TT4G35A: \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\" - This is generally true, AI can help with lesson planning. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\n2. TT4G35B: \"Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\" - AI can help with differentiation. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\n3. TT4G35C: \"Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\" - AI can help with individual support but it's not a replacement for teacher interaction. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\n4. TT4G35D: \"Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\" - AI has potential here but it's not universally reliable. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\n5. TT4G35E: \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\" - This is clearly true, administrative automation is one of AI's proven strengths. I'd say \"Strongly agree\"\n\n6. TT4G35F: \"Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\" - This is a real concern with AI like ChatGPT. This is a negative statement but accurate about risks. I'd say \"Strongly agree\" (agreeing that this risk exists)\n\n7. TT4G35G: \"Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\" - AI can make errors and inappropriate recommendations. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\n8. TT4G35H: \"Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\" - This is a known concern. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\n9. TT4G35I: \"Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\" - This is a legitimate concern. \n\nFor the final two statements, I need to consider data privacy risks and pedagogical appropriateness. Privacy concerns around student data are significant, so I'd lean toward \"Agree\" there. As for unsuitable pedagogical approaches, while AI can suggest questionable methods, this seems less certain than other risks, though I should still acknowledge it as a possibility worth considering cautiously.",
