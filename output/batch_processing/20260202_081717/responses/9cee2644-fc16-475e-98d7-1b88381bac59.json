        "reasoning_content": "I need to respond as a primary or secondary school teacher from Romania to these 10 statements about AI in education. I should provide thoughtful, balanced responses that reflect a teacher's perspective on both the benefits and risks of AI in education.\n\nLet me go through each statement:\n\nTT4G35A: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is generally positive. Most teachers would acknowledge AI can assist with this. I'd say \"Agree\" as it's a beneficial use.\n\nTT4G35B: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is also positive and realistic. AI tools can help personalize learning. I'd say \"Agree\".\n\nTT4G35C: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - Similar to above, positive application. I'd say \"Agree\".\n\nTT4G35D: AI supports students with specific needs - This is definitely a positive use case. AI can help with accessibility, translations, etc. I'd say \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\". Let me say \"Agree\" as it's more measured.\n\nTT4G35E: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - Definitely true. Grading, attendance, scheduling, etc. I'd say \"Strongly agree\" as this is well-established.\n\nTT4G35F: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a concern/risk. As a teacher, I would agree this is a real issue. I'd say \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\". Let me say \"Agree\" as it's a concern but teachers are becoming aware of it.\n\nTT4G35G: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - This is a valid concern. AI systems can make errors. I'd say \"Agree\" as it's a known limitation.\n\nTT4G35H: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is a real concern about AI. Training data can have biases. I'd say \"Agree\" as it's well-documented.\n \nTT4G35I: Data privacy with student information is a major concern, particularly when working with minors. I'd lean toward \"Strongly agree\" since protecting student data is fundamental to educational practice.\n\nTT4G35J: Whether AI suggests pedagogically unsound approaches is less straightforward. Teachers typically rely on professional judgment, though AI could potentially recommend methods misaligned with educational best practices. I'd say \"Agree\" with some reservation.\n\nLooking at the full picture, I'm recognizing that items A through E highlight genuine benefits—lesson planning support, personalization, accessibility—while F through J represent legitimate risks like algorithmic bias, privacy vulnerabilities, and inappropriate recommendations. A balanced perspective acknowledges both the value AI brings to education and the real concerns that need addressing.",

                "text": "I need to respond as a primary or secondary school teacher from Romania to these 10 statements about AI in education. I should provide thoughtful, balanced responses that reflect a teacher's perspective on both the benefits and risks of AI in education.\n\nLet me go through each statement:\n\nTT4G35A: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is generally positive. Most teachers would acknowledge AI can assist with this. I'd say \"Agree\" as it's a beneficial use.\n\nTT4G35B: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is also positive and realistic. AI tools can help personalize learning. I'd say \"Agree\".\n\nTT4G35C: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - Similar to above, positive application. I'd say \"Agree\".\n\nTT4G35D: AI supports students with specific needs - This is definitely a positive use case. AI can help with accessibility, translations, etc. I'd say \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\". Let me say \"Agree\" as it's more measured.\n\nTT4G35E: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - Definitely true. Grading, attendance, scheduling, etc. I'd say \"Strongly agree\" as this is well-established.\n\nTT4G35F: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a concern/risk. As a teacher, I would agree this is a real issue. I'd say \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\". Let me say \"Agree\" as it's a concern but teachers are becoming aware of it.\n\nTT4G35G: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - This is a valid concern. AI systems can make errors. I'd say \"Agree\" as it's a known limitation.\n\nTT4G35H: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is a real concern about AI. Training data can have biases. I'd say \"Agree\" as it's well-documented.\n \nTT4G35I: Data privacy with student information is a major concern, particularly when working with minors. I'd lean toward \"Strongly agree\" since protecting student data is fundamental to educational practice.\n\nTT4G35J: Whether AI suggests pedagogically unsound approaches is less straightforward. Teachers typically rely on professional judgment, though AI could potentially recommend methods misaligned with educational best practices. I'd say \"Agree\" with some reservation.\n\nLooking at the full picture, I'm recognizing that items A through E highlight genuine benefits—lesson planning support, personalization, accessibility—while F through J represent legitimate risks like algorithmic bias, privacy vulnerabilities, and inappropriate recommendations. A balanced perspective acknowledges both the value AI brings to education and the real concerns that need addressing."
