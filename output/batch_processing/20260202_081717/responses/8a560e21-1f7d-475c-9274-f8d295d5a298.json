I need to provide thoughtful responses based on the perspective of an educator.\n\nLet me consider each statement:\n\n[TT4G35A]: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is generally positive and I can see this as true based on practical experience. Many teachers use AI tools to help brainstorm and structure lessons. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35B]: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is also realistic. AI can help personalize content and differentiate instruction. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35C]: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - Similar to B, this is a real capability of AI in education. \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35D]: AI supports students with specific needs (multilingual learners, SEN) - This is true, AI can help with translation, text-to-speech, and adaptive learning for students with special needs. \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35E]: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - Definitely, AI can help with grading, attendance, organizing materials, etc. \"Strongly agree\"\n\n[TT4G35F]: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a concern with AI. Students could use AI to help plagiarize or cheat. However, this is more about misuse than what AI enables. I'd say \"Agree\" as it's a real concern.\n\n[TT4G35G]: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - This is true, AI systems can make mistakes and provide incorrect information. \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35H]: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is a known concern about AI systems reflecting biases in training data. \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35I]: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data - This is a legitimate concern with data storage and security. \n\nFor the remaining items, I need to consider data privacy risks and pedagogical concerns. Data security is a genuine worry when using AI systems in schools. As for pedagogical approaches, AI might recommend methods that don't fit specific classroom contexts or student populations, so that's also a valid concern worth acknowledging.",
