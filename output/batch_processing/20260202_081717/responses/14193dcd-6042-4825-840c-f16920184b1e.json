I need to provide responses to all 10 statements using the provided response options: 'Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', 'I don't know'.\n\nLet me think about reasonable responses for a teacher from Saudi Arabia:\n\nTT4G35A: \"AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans\" - This is a positive statement about AI's capability. A teacher would likely agree with this as it's a practical use case. Response: Agree\n\nTT4G35B: \"AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities\" - This is a positive capability. A teacher would likely agree. Response: Agree\n\nTT4G35C: \"AI assists teachers in supporting students individually\" - This is a positive use case. Response: Agree\n\nTT4G35D: \"AI supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs)\" - This is a positive capability, especially relevant in Saudi Arabia context. Response: Agree\n\nTT4G35E: \"AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks\" - This is a practical benefit. Response: Strongly agree (administrative tasks are often a burden)\n\nTT4G35F: \"AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own\" - This is about academic dishonesty. A teacher would likely agree this is a concern. Response: Agree\n\nTT4G35G: \"AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct\" - This is a concern about AI accuracy. Response: Agree\n\nTT4G35H: \"AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions\" - This is a concern about bias. Response: Agree\n\nTT4G35I: \"AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data\" - This is a privacy concern. Response: Agree\n\nTT4G35J: \"AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students\" - This is a concern.
