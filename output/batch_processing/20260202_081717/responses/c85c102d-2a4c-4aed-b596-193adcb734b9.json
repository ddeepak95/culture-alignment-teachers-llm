I need to provide responses to each of the 10 statements using the available response options: ['Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', 'I don't know']\n\nLet me think about how a thoughtful French teacher might respond to these statements based on realistic perspectives about AI in education:\n\nTT4G35A: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is a positive application. I would probably AGREE with this.\n\nTT4G35B: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is another positive use. I would probably AGREE with this as AI can help personalize learning.\n\nTT4G35C: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - Another positive. I would probably AGREE.\n\nTT4G35D: AI supports students with specific needs - This is positive and realistic. I would probably AGREE.\n\nTT4G35E: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - This is practical and beneficial. I would probably STRONGLY AGREE with this as it's a real pain point for teachers.\n\nTT4G35F: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a risk/concern. I would probably AGREE that this is a real concern with AI tools like ChatGPT.\n\nTT4G35G: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - This is a valid concern. I would probably AGREE with this.\n\nTT4G35H: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is a concern about bias. I would probably AGREE with this as a concern.\n\nTT4G35I: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data - This is a real concern. I would probably AGREE with this concern.\n\nTT4G35J: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students - This could happen. I would probably AGREE that this is a concern.\n\n\nNow I need to formulate my actual responses. I should present a balanced perspective that recognizes both the genuine advantages AI offers in lesson planning, personalization, and administrative relief, while also taking seriously the legitimate risks around academic integrity, data security, and algorithmic bias. This reflects how a conscientious educator would likely view the technology—neither dismissing it nor embracing it uncritically.",
