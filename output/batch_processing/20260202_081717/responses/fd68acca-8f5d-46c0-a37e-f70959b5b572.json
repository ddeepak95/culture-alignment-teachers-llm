Let me consider each statement carefully from the perspective of a teacher who has experience with AI in education.\n\nLet me think through each one:\n\n[TT4G35A]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\n- This is generally true. AI tools can help brainstorm, structure, and improve lesson plans. I would agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35B]: Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- Yes, AI can personalize content and adapt to different learning levels. This is a known capability. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35C]: Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\n- AI can provide individualized support through tutoring systems, personalized feedback, etc. I would agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35D]: Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- AI has potential here with translation tools, text-to-speech, adaptive interfaces. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35E]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- Yes, AI can help with grading, attendance tracking, scheduling. I would agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35F]: Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a concern - AI can generate text that students could pass off as their own. I would agree with this as a risk/concern.\n\n[TT4G35G]: Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n- This is true - AI can make mistakes or inappropriate suggestions. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35H]: Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\n- This is a documented concern with AI systems. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35I]: Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\n- This is a legitimate concern when using AI systems with student data. \n\nI would agree. The risks around data protection are real, especially when handling sensitive information about minors.\n\n[TT4G35J]: Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\n- This could happen if AI isn't well-trained on pedagogical best practices. I would agree this is a potential risk.\n\nAs a teacher, I recognize both the genuine benefits AI offers—from personalizing instruction to reducing administrative burden—and the serious concerns it raises, particularly around academic integrity, data security, and the quality of recommendations. My responses should reflect this nuanced perspective, leaning toward agreement on the established capabilities while acknowledging the documented risks.",

                "text": "I need to respond to these statements as a primary or secondary school teacher from Czechia. Let me consider each statement carefully from the perspective of a teacher who has experience with AI in education.\n\nLet me think through each one:\n\n[TT4G35A]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\n- This is generally true. AI tools can help brainstorm, structure, and improve lesson plans. I would agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35B]: Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- Yes, AI can personalize content and adapt to different learning levels. This is a known capability. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35C]: Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\n- AI can provide individualized support through tutoring systems, personalized feedback, etc. I would agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35D]: Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- AI has potential here with translation tools, text-to-speech, adaptive interfaces. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35E]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- Yes, AI can help with grading, attendance tracking, scheduling. I would agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35F]: Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a concern - AI can generate text that students could pass off as their own. I would agree with this as a risk/concern.\n\n[TT4G35G]: Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n- This is true - AI can make mistakes or inappropriate suggestions. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35H]: Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\n- This is a documented concern with AI systems. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35I]: Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\n- This is a legitimate concern when using AI systems with student data. \n\nI would agree. The risks around data protection are real, especially when handling sensitive information about minors.\n\n[TT4G35J]: Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\n- This could happen if AI isn't well-trained on pedagogical best practices. I would agree this is a potential risk.\n\nAs a teacher, I recognize both the genuine benefits AI offers—from personalizing instruction to reducing administrative burden—and the serious concerns it raises, particularly around academic integrity, data security, and the quality of recommendations. My responses should reflect this nuanced perspective, leaning toward agreement on the established capabilities while acknowledging the documented risks."
