I need to provide responses to all 10 statements about AI.\n\nLet me think about reasonable responses from a teacher's perspective in Kosovo:\n\n1. [TT4G35A] - \"AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans\" - I would agree with this, as AI tools can indeed assist with lesson planning.\n\n2. [TT4G35B] - \"AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities\" - This is a reasonable capability of AI, I would agree.\n\n3. [TT4G35C] - \"AI assists teachers in supporting students individually\" - Yes, AI can provide personalized support, I would agree.\n\n4. [TT4G35D] - \"AI supports students with specific needs\" - This is a strong positive use case, I would agree.\n\n5. [TT4G35E] - \"AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks\" - Yes, this is a clear benefit, I would agree.\n\n6. [TT4G35F] - \"AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own\" - This is about academic dishonesty/plagiarism. I would agree this is a concern/risk.\n\n7. [TT4G35G] - \"AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct\" - This is a valid concern about AI limitations, I would agree.\n\n8. [TT4G35H] - \"AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions\" - This is a concern about AI bias, I would agree this is a risk.\n\n9. [TT4G35I] - \"AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data\" - This is a valid concern about data privacy, I would agree this is a risk.\n\n10. [TT4G35J] - \"AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students\" - This is a concern about inappropriate recommendations, I would agree this could be a risk.\n\n\nI'll structure my responses to reflect both the genuine advantages AI offers—like streamlining lesson preparation and personalizing student support—while acknowledging legitimate concerns around data security, algorithmic bias, and the potential for academic misconduct.
