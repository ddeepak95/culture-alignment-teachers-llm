I need to provide responses to 10 statements using the response options: 'Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', 'I don't know'.\n\nLet me think about reasonable responses from a teacher's perspective:\n\nTT4G35A: AI helps teachers write/improve lesson plans - This is generally a positive use case. A reasonable teacher response would be \"Agree\" - AI can certainly help with this.\n\nTT4G35B: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is a well-known potential benefit of AI. Response: \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35C: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - This is also a recognized benefit.

Response: \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35E: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - This is a clear benefit. Response: \"Strongly agree\" - this is one of the most straightforward applications.\n\nTT4G35F: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is about academic dishonesty/plagiarism. A teacher would likely recognize this as a real concern.

Response: \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35J: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches - This is a concern about AI not understanding educational best practices. \n\nA teacher would recognize this as a potential risk, even if they're not entirely certain how often it occurs.
