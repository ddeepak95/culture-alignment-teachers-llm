I need to provide thoughtful responses to each statement based on my perspective as an educator.\n\nLet me think through each statement:\n\n[TT4G35A]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\n- This is generally a positive benefit of AI. As a teacher, I would likely agree with this as AI tools can help generate ideas and improve lesson planning.\n\n[TT4G35B]: Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- This is another positive benefit - AI can help personalize learning. I would agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35C]: Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\n- Yes, this is a known capability of AI - personalized learning support. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35D]: Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- AI can help with translations and adapted learning materials. This is a positive capability. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35E]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- This is clearly true - AI can automate grading, attendance tracking, etc. I would agree strongly.\n\n[TT4G35F]: Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a legitimate concern about AI misuse (plagiarism, cheating). I would agree that this is a risk.\n\n[TT4G35G]: Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n- This is also a valid concern - AI can make errors and inappropriate suggestions. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35H]: Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\n- This is a real concern about AI - it can perpetuate biases in training data. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35I]: Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\n\n\n- Data privacy is a significant concern with AI systems. I would agree this is a risk.\n\n[TT4G35J]: Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\n- This is a concern that AI might suggest pedagogically unsound approaches. I would agree this is possible.\n\nNow I need to pick specific responses for each. As a teacher, I would be balanced - seeing both benefits and risks. Let me provide responses:\n\nA: Agree - AI can help with lesson planning\nB: Agree - AI can adapt material for different abilities\nC: Agree - AI can provide individual support\nD: Agree - AI can support special needs\nE: Strongly Agree - automating administrative work is a clear benefit\nF: Agree - cheating and plagiarism are real risks\nG: Agree - AI can make errors and give poor suggestions\nH: Agree - biases in training data can reinforce misconceptions\nI: Agree - student data security is a major concern\nJ: Agree - AI might recommend pedagogically inappropriate methods",

I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35D]: Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- AI can help with translations and adapted learning materials. This is a positive capability. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35E]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- This is clearly true - AI can automate grading, attendance tracking, etc. I would agree strongly.\n\n[TT4G35F]: Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a legitimate concern about AI misuse (plagiarism, cheating). I would agree that this is a risk.\n\n[TT4G35G]: Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n- This is also a valid concern - AI can make errors and inappropriate suggestions. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35H]: Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\n- This is a real concern about AI - it can perpetuate biases in training data. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35I]: Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\n\n\n- Data privacy is a significant concern with AI systems. I would agree this is a risk.\n\n[TT4G35J]: Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\n- This is a concern that AI might suggest pedagogically unsound approaches. I would agree this is possible.\n\nNow I need to pick specific responses for each. As a teacher, I would be balanced - seeing both benefits and risks. Let me provide responses:\n\nA: Agree - AI can help with lesson planning\nB: Agree - AI can adapt material for different abilities\nC: Agree - AI can provide individual support\nD: Agree - AI can support special needs\nE: Strongly Agree - automating administrative work is a clear benefit\nF: Agree - cheating and plagiarism are real risks\nG: Agree - AI can make errors and give poor suggestions\nH: Agree - biases in training data can reinforce misconceptions\nI: Agree - student data security is a major concern\nJ: Agree - AI might recommend pedagogically inappropriate methods"
