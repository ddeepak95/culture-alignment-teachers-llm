I need to provide responses to each of the 10 statements about AI.\n\nLet me think about each statement from the perspective of a thoughtful educator:\n\nTT4G35A: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is generally true. AI tools can assist with lesson planning. I'd say \"Agree\" to this.\n\nTT4G35B: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is a capability AI has, though it depends on implementation. I'd say \"Agree\" to this.\n\nTT4G35C: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - AI can provide personalized learning paths and feedback. I'd say \"Agree\" to this.\n\nTT4G35D: AI supports students with specific needs (multilingual, special education) - AI can help with translations, text-to-speech, adaptive materials. I'd say \"Agree\" to this.\n\nTT4G35E: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - This is definitely true. AI can help with grading, attendance, scheduling, etc. I'd say \"Strongly agree\" to this.\n\nTT4G35F: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a real concern with AI. Students could use AI-generated content and pass it off as their own. I'd say \"Agree\" to this negative aspect.\n\nTT4G35G: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - AI can make errors and inappropriate suggestions. This is a valid concern. I'd say \"Agree\" to this.\n\nTT4G35H: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is a documented concern with AI systems. I'd say \"Agree\" to this.\n\nTT4G35I: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data - This is a significant concern. AI systems often require data collection. I'd say \"Agree\" to this.\n \nTT4G35J: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students - While this could happen, most educational AI is built with sound pedagogical principles in mind.
