However, as a teacher, I should acknowledge this is a risk but perhaps not \"strongly agree\" since it's about enabling a behavior, not necessarily making it inevitable. Response: \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35G]: Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n- AI systems can definitely make errors, provide incorrect information, or suggest inappropriate content. \n\nAI has known limitations when it comes to accuracy and appropriateness.

                "text": "The user is asking me to respond to a survey about AI in education as if I were a primary or secondary school teacher from Serbia. I need to provide responses to 10 statements about AI in education.\n\nLet me think about each statement carefully from the perspective of a Serbian teacher who understands both the potential benefits and risks of AI in education:\n\n[TT4G35A]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\n- This is generally true. AI tools can help with brainstorming, organizing content, creating structured lesson plans. I would agree with this. Response: \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35B]: Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- AI can help with differentiated instruction by suggesting different approaches for different learners. This is a legitimate capability. Response: \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35C]: Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\n- AI can provide personalized learning suggestions and support. This is a reasonable capability. Response: \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35D]: Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- AI can indeed help with translation, text-to-speech, adapted content for different learning needs. Response: \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35E]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- This is clearly true - grading, attendance tracking, scheduling, report writing can be automated. Response: \"Strongly agree\"\n\n[TT4G35F]: Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is unfortunately a real concern with AI tools like ChatGPT. However, as a teacher, I should acknowledge this is a risk but perhaps not \"strongly agree\" since it's about enabling a behavior, not necessarily making it inevitable. Response: \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35G]: Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n- AI systems can definitely make errors, provide incorrect information, or suggest inappropriate content. \n\nAI has known limitations when it comes to accuracy and appropriateness. Response: \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35H]: Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\n- AI systems can perpetuate biases present in their training data, which could reinforce existing misconceptions. Response: \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35I]: Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\n- Data privacy and security are legitimate concerns when AI systems collect and process student information. Response: \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35J]: Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\n- AI might recommend teaching methods that don't fit particular classroom contexts or student populations, so this is a valid concern. Response: \"Agree\"\n\nI'm trying to strike a balance here—acknowledging real risks while recognizing that these aren't necessarily inevitable outcomes. A teacher's perspective would appreciate that these are genuine concerns worth taking seriously."
