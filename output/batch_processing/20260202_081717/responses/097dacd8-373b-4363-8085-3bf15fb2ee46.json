AI tools can assist with creating, organizing, and improving lesson plans. I would AGREE.\n\nTT4G35B - AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities: This is true. AI can help personalize learning. I would AGREE.\n\nTT4G35C - AI assists teachers in supporting students individually: This is true. AI tools can provide individualized support. I would AGREE.\n\nTT4G35D - AI supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs): This is increasingly true with specialized AI tools. I would AGREE.\n\nTT4G35E - AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks: This is definitely true. I would STRONGLY AGREE.\n\nTT4G35F - AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own: This is a valid concern about AI (plagiarism, academic dishonesty). I would AGREE.\n\nTT4G35G - AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct: This is a valid concern about AI accuracy and appropriateness. I would AGREE.\n\nTT4G35H - AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions: This is a known concern with AI. I would AGREE.\n\nTT4G35I - AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data: This is a valid concern about data protection. I would AGREE.\n\nTT4G35J - AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students: This is a concern about AI-generated pedagogical advice. \n\nI would AGREE.
