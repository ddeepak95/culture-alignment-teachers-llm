I need to provide responses to each of the 10 statements about AI in education.\n\nLet me think about each statement from the perspective of a reasonable, balanced educator:\n\n1. [TT4G35A] - AI helps write/improve lesson plans: This is generally true. AI tools like ChatGPT can help generate ideas and draft materials. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n2. [TT4G35B] - AI enables adapting material to different students' abilities: AI can personalize learning, though implementation varies. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n3. [TT4G35C] - AI assists in individual student support: AI can provide personalized feedback and support. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n4. [TT4G35D] - AI supports students with specific needs: AI can help with accessibility, translation, differentiation. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n5. [TT4G35E] - AI helps automate administrative tasks: Definitely true. Grading, record-keeping, scheduling can be automated. I would say \"Strongly agree\"\n\n6. [TT4G35F] - AI enables plagiarism/misrepresenting work: This is a legitimate concern. Students can use AI to pass off generated text as their own. I would say \"Agree\" (because it's a real problem)\n\n7. [TT4G35G] - AI makes inappropriate/incorrect recommendations: AI can make mistakes and have limitations. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n8. [TT4G35H] - AI amplifies biases: This is well-documented concern about AI. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n9. [TT4G35I] - AI jeopardizes privacy/security: Data protection is a real concern with AI systems. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n10. [TT4G35J] - AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches: This is possible, though not always. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n\nI want to approach this thoughtfully, recognizing both the genuine advantages AI offers—like streamlining administrative work and personalizing instruction—alongside the legitimate concerns around academic integrity, algorithmic bias, and data security. My responses will reflect this nuanced view.",
