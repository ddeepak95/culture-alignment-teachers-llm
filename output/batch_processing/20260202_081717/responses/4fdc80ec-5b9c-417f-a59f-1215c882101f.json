I need to provide responses to 10 statements about AI in education.\n\nLooking at these statements, they cover both positive and negative aspects of AI in education:\n- Positive aspects: TT4G35A, TT4G35B, TT4G35C, TT4G35D, TT4G35E (helping with lesson plans, adapting materials, supporting students, helping with admin)\n- Negative aspects/risks: TT4G35F, TT4G35G, TT4G35H, TT4G35I, TT4G35J (plagiarism, poor recommendations, bias, privacy, unsuitable pedagogy)\n\nAs a thoughtful teacher from Australia who would be responding to this survey, I should provide balanced responses that reflect:\n1. Recognition of genuine benefits of AI in education\n2. Legitimate concerns about risks and limitations\n3. A measured, professional perspective\n\nLet me provide responses that seem reasonable for an experienced educator:\n\nTT4G35A (helps write/improve lesson plans) - This is increasingly true. Many teachers use AI for this. I'd say \"Agree\" - it can help but isn't a replacement.\n\nTT4G35B (adapt to different abilities) - This is a promising capability of AI. \"Agree\" seems appropriate.\n\nTT4G35C (support students individually) - AI has potential here but also limitations. \"Agree\" with some qualification in mind.\n\nTT4G35D (support specific needs) - AI accessibility tools can help. \"Agree\" seems fair.\n\nTT4G35E (automate admin tasks) - This is definitely a real benefit. \"Strongly agree\" or \"Agree\". I'll go with \"Agree\".\n\nTT4G35F (enables plagiarism) - Yes, this is a real concern. \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\". I'll say \"Agree\" - it's a genuine risk that needs addressing.\n\n\nFor the remaining concerns, I need to consider the documented risks. AI systems can produce inaccurate information and reinforce existing biases in training data, both significant issues in an educational context. Privacy and data security are legitimate worries when using these tools with student information. Additionally, there's a risk that over-reliance on AI could undermine sound pedagogical practices if not implemented thoughtfully. I'll respond with \"Agree\" to each of these concerns, reflecting a balanced perspective that acknowledges real limitations alongside the potential benefits.",
