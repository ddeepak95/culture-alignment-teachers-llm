AI can indeed help with lesson planning by providing suggestions, templates, and resources. I would agree with this. Response: \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35B: \"Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\"\n- This is another positive use case.

AI can provide personalized learning paths and support.

While AI can be misused this way, I should consider whether I agree this is something AI \"enables\". This is a concern, but I'll say \"Agree\" - this is a real risk.\n\nTT4G35G: \"Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\"\n- This is a valid concern. AI systems can make mistakes or inappropriate recommendations. \n\nTT4G35H: \"Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\"\n- This is a concern about bias in AI systems. This is a real issue that has been documented. Response: \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35I: \"Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\"\n- This is a concern about data privacy. This is a legitimate concern with AI systems handling student data.

AI systems might suggest approaches that don't align with sound educational practices or classroom context.

While AI can be misused this way, I should consider whether I agree this is something AI \"enables\". This is a concern, but I'll say \"Agree\" - this is a real risk.\n\nTT4G35G: \"Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\"\n- This is a valid concern. AI systems can make mistakes or inappropriate recommendations. \n\nTT4G35H: \"Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\"\n- This is a concern about bias in AI systems. This is a real issue that has been documented. Response: \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35I: \"Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\"\n- This is a concern about data privacy. This is a legitimate concern with AI systems handling student data. Response: \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35J: \"Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\"\n- This is a concern about pedagogical appropriateness. AI systems might suggest approaches that don't align with sound educational practices or classroom context. Response: \"Agree\"\n\nFor the remaining concerns about AI—inaccurate recommendations, bias amplification, data privacy risks, and pedagogical misalignment—I recognize these as legitimate challenges that educators face when implementing AI tools in classrooms."
