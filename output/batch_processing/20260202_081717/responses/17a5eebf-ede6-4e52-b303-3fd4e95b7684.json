Let me think about each statement:\n\n[TT4G35A]: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is generally true, AI can assist with lesson planning. I'd say \"Agree\" as AI tools can be helpful for this.\n\n[TT4G35B]: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is possible with AI, though it depends on implementation. \"Agree\" seems appropriate.\n\n[TT4G35C]: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - Yes, personalized learning and adaptive systems can help. \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35D]: AI supports students with specific needs - AI can provide accommodations for multilingual learners and those with special needs. \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35E]: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - Definitely, this is a clear benefit. \"Strongly agree\" or \"Agree\". I'd say \"Agree\" is reasonable.\n\n[TT4G35F]: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a risk/concern, not really a benefit but an acknowledgment of a problem. A teacher would likely \"Agree\" that this is possible.\n\n[TT4G35G]: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - Yes, this is a valid concern. \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35H]: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is a concern. \"Agree\" seems reasonable as this is a known issue with AI.\n\n[TT4G35I]: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data - This is a concern. \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\" - I'd say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35J]: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students - This could happen. \"Agree\" seems reasonable.\n\n\nI should provide a balanced set of responses that acknowledge both the genuine benefits AI offers in educational contexts—like streamlining lesson preparation and personalizing instruction—while also recognizing legitimate concerns around data security, algorithmic bias, and the potential for misuse. Most statements warrant agreement, reflecting a realistic teacher's perspective that sees value in AI tools while remaining cautious about their limitations and risks.",
