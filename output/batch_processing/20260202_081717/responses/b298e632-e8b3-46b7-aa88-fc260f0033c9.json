I need to provide responses to each of the 10 statements using the response options: 'Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', 'I don't know'.\n\nLet me think about reasonable responses from the perspective of a teacher who would have experience with AI in education:\n\nTT4G35A: \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\" - This is a positive statement about AI's capability. Teachers would likely recognize this as accurate, as AI tools can help with lesson planning. Response: \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35B: \"Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\" - This is about personalization and differentiation, which is a known capability of AI. Response: \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35C: \"Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\" - Similar to B, this relates to individualized support. Response: \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35D: \"Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\" - AI can provide specialized support. Response: \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35E: \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\" - This is clearly a capability of AI. Response: \"Strongly agree\"\n\nTT4G35F: \"Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\" - This is a risk/concern statement about academic integrity and misuse of AI. Teachers would likely be aware of this concern. Response: \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35G: \"Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\" - This is a legitimate concern about AI accuracy and reliability. Response: \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35H: \"Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\" - This is a concern about bias in AI systems. \n\nFor the remaining statements, I recognize several legitimate concerns. AI systems can indeed make inappropriate recommendations, and there are real risks around data privacy and security that teachers would be concerned about. The potential for AI to reinforce biases or suggest unsuitable teaching methods are also valid worries from an educator's perspective. Response: \"Agree\" for H, I, and J.",
