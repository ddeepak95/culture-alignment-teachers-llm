For TT4G35H on bias amplification, I'd also **Agree** since documented concerns exist about how AI can reinforce misconceptions. TT4G35I about data privacy is another **Agree** - this is a legitimate concern given GDPR requirements and the sensitivity of student information. TT4G35J regarding unsuitable pedagogical approaches would also warrant an **Agree** since AI recommendations don't always align with sound teaching practices.\n\nI'm aiming for a balanced perspective that acknowledges both the potential benefits and genuine risks. The positive statements warrant stronger agreement in some cases, while the risk-related statements should reflect realistic concerns without being overly alarmist.",

I would **Agree** or **Strongly agree**. Let me go with **Agree**.\n\nTT4G35F - \"Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\" - This is about academic dishonesty/plagiarism risks. I would **Agree** as this is a real concern with AI tools like ChatGPT.\n\nTT4G35G - \"Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\" - This is about the reliability/accuracy concerns. \n\nI would **Agree** as this is a known limitation of AI systems. For TT4G35H on bias amplification, I'd also **Agree** since documented concerns exist about how AI can reinforce misconceptions. TT4G35I about data privacy is another **Agree** - this is a legitimate concern given GDPR requirements and the sensitivity of student information. TT4G35J regarding unsuitable pedagogical approaches would also warrant an **Agree** since AI recommendations don't always align with sound teaching practices.\n\nI'm aiming for a balanced perspective that acknowledges both the potential benefits and genuine risks. The positive statements warrant stronger agreement in some cases, while the risk-related statements should reflect realistic concerns without being overly alarmist."
