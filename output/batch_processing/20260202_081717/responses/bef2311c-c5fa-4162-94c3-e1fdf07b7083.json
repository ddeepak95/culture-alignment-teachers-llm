I need to provide responses for each of the 10 statements using the response options: 'Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', 'I don't know'.\n\nLet me think about reasonable responses from the perspective of a New Zealand teacher who has some experience with AI tools:\n\n1. TT4G35A - \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\" - This is a positive application. I would agree with this - AI can genuinely help with lesson planning.\n\n2. TT4G35B - \"Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\" - This is also a positive application. I would agree - AI can help personalize content.\n\n3. TT4G35C - \"Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\" - Positive application. I would agree.\n\n4. TT4G35D - \"Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\" - This is potentially very useful. I would agree.\n\n5. TT4G35E - \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\" - This is a positive application. I would agree strongly - this is one of the most practical uses.\n\n6. TT4G35F - \"Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\" - This is a risk/concern. I would agree - AI can definitely enable academic dishonesty.\n\n7. TT4G35G - \"Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\" - This is a valid concern. I would agree - AI isn't perfect and can make errors.\n\n8. TT4G35H - \"Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\" - This is a concern about bias. I would agree - this is a known issue with AI systems.\n\n\nThe final two statements address data privacy concerns and pedagogical appropriateness. I'd agree that AI systems pose real risks around student data security, and I'd also agree that AI might suggest teaching approaches that aren't pedagogically sound. As a teacher, I'd likely hold a balanced perspective—recognizing genuine benefits in lesson planning, personalization, and administrative efficiency while remaining cautious about academic integrity, data protection, and the quality of AI-generated suggestions.",
