Let me think through each statement carefully and provide thoughtful responses:\n\n[TT4G35A]: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is generally true. AI can assist in generating content, organizing ideas, and providing suggestions. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35B]: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is possible through adaptive learning systems and personalized content. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35C]: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - AI can help with personalized learning, tutoring assistance, and individual feedback. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35D]: AI supports students with specific needs - AI can provide multilingual support, accessibility features, and differentiated content for students with special needs. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35E]: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - This is clearly true. AI can help with grading, attendance, scheduling, etc. I would say \"Strongly agree\"\n\n[TT4G35F]: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a concern about academic integrity and plagiarism using AI. This is a real risk. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35G]: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - AI can make errors and inappropriate suggestions. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35H]: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is a known issue with AI systems reflecting training data biases. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35I]: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data - There are legitimate concerns about data privacy when using AI systems. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35J]: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches - AI may not always suggest pedagogically sound approaches. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n\nNow I need to format these responses according to the required structure.",
