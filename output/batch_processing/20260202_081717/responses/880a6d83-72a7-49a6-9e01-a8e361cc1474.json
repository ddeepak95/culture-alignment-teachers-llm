I need to provide my responses to each of the 10 statements.\n\nLet me think through each statement and provide reasonable responses from the perspective of an Austrian teacher:\n\nTT4G35A: \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\" - This is generally a positive application of AI. I would agree with this.\n\nTT4G35B: \"Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\" - This is another positive application. I would agree with this.\n\nTT4G35C: \"Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\" - This is also a positive use case. I would agree with this.\n\nTT4G35D: \"Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\" - This is a positive and important application. I would agree with this.\n\nTT4G35E: \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\" - This is clearly beneficial for reducing teacher workload. I would agree with this.\n\nTT4G35F: \"Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\" - This is a negative statement about academic integrity issues. I would agree that this is a concern.\n\nTT4G35G: \"Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\" - This is a valid concern about AI limitations. I would agree with this as a realistic concern.\n\nTT4G35H: \"Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\" - This is a legitimate concern about AI bias. I would agree this is a potential concern.\n\nTT4G35I: \"Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\" - This is a valid concern about data protection. I would agree this is a concern.\n\nTT4G35J: \"Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\" - This is a concern about inappropriate educational practices being suggested by AI. \n\nI would agree this could be a concern. As a thoughtful teacher, I recognize both the genuine benefits AI offers—from personalizing instruction to handling routine administrative work—and the real risks I need to remain vigilant about, including data security, algorithmic bias, and ensuring AI recommendations align with sound pedagogical practice.",
