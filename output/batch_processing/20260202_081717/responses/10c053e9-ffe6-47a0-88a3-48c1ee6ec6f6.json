Let me think about each one carefully from a teacher's perspective:\n\n[TT4G35A]: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - I think this is generally true, AI tools can assist with brainstorming and structuring lesson plans. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35B]: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is a capability AI can have through personalization algorithms. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35C]: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - AI can provide personalized feedback and support. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35D]: AI supports students with specific needs - AI can be very helpful for multilingual learners and students with special needs through text-to-speech, translations, etc. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35E]: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - Definitely, grading, record-keeping, scheduling can be automated. I would say \"Strongly agree\"\n\n[TT4G35F]: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a concern with generative AI. This is a real risk. I would say \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\"\n\n[TT4G35G]: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - AI systems can make errors and inappropriate suggestions. This is a valid concern. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35H]: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is a known issue with AI systems reflecting biases in training data. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35I]: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data - Data privacy is a legitimate concern with AI systems. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35J]: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students - AI might not always understand proper pedagogy. \n\nFor this last one, I'm uncertain whether to agree or remain neutral, as AI systems may lack nuanced understanding of effective teaching methods. I'd lean toward \"Agree\" or possibly \"I don't know\" depending on the context.",
