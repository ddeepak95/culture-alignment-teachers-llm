Let me consider each statement:\n\n[TT4G35A]: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is generally true, AI can assist with this. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35B]: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is a capability AI can provide through personalization. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35C]: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - Yes, AI can help with individualized support. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35D]: AI supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs) - This is an emerging capability that shows promise. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35E]: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - This is definitely true, automation is one of AI's strengths.

I'll say \"Agree\"\n\nAs a teacher, I would likely have a balanced view - recognizing both the potential benefits (first 5 statements) and the real concerns/risks (last 5 statements). \n\nThese concerns reflect genuine challenges that educators face when implementing AI tools in classrooms.
