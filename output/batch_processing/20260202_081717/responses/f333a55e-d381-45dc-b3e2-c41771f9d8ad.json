I should respond based on my understanding of AI's actual capabilities and limitations.\n\nLet me think about each statement:\n\nTT4G35A: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\n- This is true. AI tools can assist in generating content, organizing ideas, and improving lesson plans. I would AGREE.\n\nTT4G35B: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- This is a capability that AI can support through adaptive learning systems. I would AGREE.\n\nTT4G35C: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually.\n- AI can provide personalized feedback, tutoring support, etc. I would AGREE.\n\nTT4G35D: AI supports students with specific needs (multilingual learners, special education needs).\n- AI can provide translation, text-to-speech, customized content for different learning needs. I would AGREE.\n\nTT4G35E: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- This is definitely true. AI can help with grading, attendance, scheduling, etc. I would STRONGLY AGREE.\n\nTT4G35F: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a legitimate concern. AI tools like ChatGPT can be used to plagiarize. I would AGREE this is a risk.\n\nTT4G35G: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n- AI systems can make errors and inappropriate suggestions. This is a known limitation. I would AGREE.\n\nTT4G35H: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\n- This is a real concern - AI trained on biased data can amplify biases. I would AGREE.\n\nTT4G35I: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\n- This is a legitimate concern when using AI systems with student data. \n\nTT4G35J: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\n- This is possible if AI makes suggestions without understanding proper pedagogy. I would AGREE or STRONGLY AGREE.\n\nI need to balance the benefits AI offers in lesson planning, personalization, and administrative efficiency against real risks like plagiarism, data privacy, bias amplification, and pedagogically unsound recommendations.",
