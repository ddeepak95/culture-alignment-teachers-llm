I need to provide responses to 10 statements about AI in education.\n\nLet me think about reasonable responses from the perspective of a teacher:\n\nTT4G35A: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is reasonable. Many AI tools can help generate lesson plan ideas. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35B: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is possible with AI-powered adaptive learning systems. \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35C: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - AI can help with personalized feedback and support. \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35D: AI supports students with specific needs (multilingual, special education) - AI tools can help with translation, text-to-speech, etc. \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35E: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - AI can definitely help with grading, scheduling, attendance, etc. \"Strongly agree\"\n\nTT4G35F: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a legitimate concern with tools like ChatGPT. A teacher would likely acknowledge this is a real risk. \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\"\n\nTT4G35G: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - AI tools are not infallible and can make errors or inappropriate suggestions. \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35H: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is a known issue with AI trained on biased data. \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35I: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data - There are legitimate privacy concerns with AI systems collecting student data. \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\"\n\nTT4G35J: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches - This is possible if AI doesn't understand context or individual student needs. \"Agree\"\n\nI should provide balanced responses that reflect both the benefits and risks of AI in education.
