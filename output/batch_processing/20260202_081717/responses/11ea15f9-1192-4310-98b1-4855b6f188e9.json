I should provide thoughtful, realistic responses that reflect both the benefits and concerns about AI in education.\n\nLet me consider each statement:\n\n[TT4G35A]: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is a beneficial use case. I would agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35B]: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is also a positive use case. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35C]: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - This is about individualized support, which is beneficial. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35D]: AI supports students with specific needs - This is about accessibility and support for diverse learners. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35E]: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - This is clearly beneficial as it reduces administrative burden. I would strongly agree.\n\n[TT4G35F]: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work - This is about academic integrity concerns. I would strongly agree with this concern.\n\n[TT4G35G]: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - This is a valid concern. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35H]: AI amplifies biases - This is a known concern about AI. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35I]: AI jeopardises privacy and security of student data - This is a legitimate concern. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35J]: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches - This is also a concern. I would agree.\n\nLet me provide realistic responses that a Finnish teacher might give:\n- A: Agree - AI tools can help with lesson planning\n- B: Agree - AI can help personalize learning\n- C: Agree - AI can support individualized learning\n- D: Agree - AI can help with accessibility\n- E: Strongly agree - Administrative automation is valuable\n\n\n- F: Strongly agree - Academic dishonesty through AI is a real risk\n- G: Agree - AI recommendations require critical teacher evaluation\n- H: Agree - Algorithmic bias is a documented problem\n- I: Strongly agree - Protecting student data is non-negotiable\n- J: Agree - Not all AI-generated pedagogical suggestions align with sound teaching practices\n\nNow I'll prepare the function calls with these responses.",
