AI tools can help with brainstorming and organizing lesson plans. I would say: Agree\n\n[TT4G35B]: Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- AI can help with differentiation and personalized learning. This is a realistic capability. I would say: Agree\n\n[TT4G35C]: Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\n- AI can provide individualized feedback and tutoring. This is realistic. I would say: Agree\n\n[TT4G35D]: Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- AI can help with accessibility and personalized support. This is increasingly true. I would say: Agree\n\n[TT4G35E]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- This is clearly true - grading, attendance, scheduling, etc. can be automated. I would say: Strongly agree\n\n[TT4G35F]: Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a risk with AI - students can use it to plagiarize or submit AI-generated work as their own. This is a concern. I would say: Strongly agree (this is a negative capability, but I agree it exists)\n\n[TT4G35G]: Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n- AI systems can make errors or unsuitable recommendations. \n\n[TT4G35H]: Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\n- AI systems can perpetuate biases present in their training data. This is a known concern. I would say: Agree\n\n[TT4G35I]: Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\n- There are privacy and security risks with AI systems handling student data. This is a legitimate concern. I would say: Agree\n\n[TT4G35J]: Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\n- AI recommendations might not always align with best pedagogical practices. This is a concern. I would say: Agree\n\nI recognize both the potential benefits of AI for lesson planning, differentiation, and administrative efficiency, as well as significant risks around student plagiarism, data privacy, algorithmic bias, and pedagogically unsound recommendations. The concerns about AI's limitations and potential harms feel particularly salient to me as an educator.",
