I need to provide responses to 10 statements about AI in education.\n\nLet me think about appropriate responses for each statement from a teacher's perspective:\n\n1. [TT4G35A] AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is a positive use case. Most teachers would likely agree that AI can assist with this. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\n2. [TT4G35B] AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is also a positive use case showing personalization. \"Agree\"\n\n3.
