I need to indicate my level of agreement with each statement using the response options: 'Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', 'I don't know'.\n\nLet me think about reasonable responses for each statement from the perspective of a teacher in Kosovo:\n\n[TT4G35A]: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is a reasonable positive use case. I would say \"Agree\" as AI tools can assist with this.\n\n[TT4G35B]: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is also a positive capability. I would say \"Agree\" as adaptive learning is a known AI capability.\n\n[TT4G35C]: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - Another positive use. I would say \"Agree\" as personalized support is possible with AI.\n\n[TT4G35D]: AI supports students with specific needs (multilingual, special education) - Positive use for accessibility. I would say \"Agree\" as this is an important capability.\n\n[TT4G35E]: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - Definitely a known positive use. I would say \"Strongly agree\" as this is widely recognized.\n\n[TT4G35F]: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is about academic dishonesty/plagiarism concerns. This is a legitimate risk. I would say \"Agree\" as this is a real concern with AI tools like ChatGPT.\n\n[TT4G35G]: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - This is a concern about AI accuracy/reliability. I would say \"Agree\" as this is a valid concern.\n\n[TT4G35H]: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is about bias in AI systems. I would say \"Agree\" as this is a documented concern.\n\n\nData protection is a significant worry with AI systems handling student information, so I'd agree with that concern. Similarly, AI might recommend teaching methods that don't align with sound pedagogical practice, which is also worth considering.",
