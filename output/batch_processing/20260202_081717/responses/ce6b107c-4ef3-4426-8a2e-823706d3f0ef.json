I need to provide thoughtful responses to each statement about AI in education.\n\nLet me think about each statement from the perspective of a thoughtful educator:\n\n[TT4G35A]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\n- This is a positive application. AI can indeed help with drafting and improving lesson plans. I would \"Agree\" with this.\n\n[TT4G35B]: Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- AI can analyze student performance and suggest adaptations.

I would \"Agree\" with this.\n\n[TT4G35E]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- This is clearly true - AI can automate grading, scheduling, etc. I would \"Strongly agree\" with this.\n\n[TT4G35F]: Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a real concern - AI can be used to plagiarize or cheat. This is a negative but true concern. I would \"Agree\" with this.\n\n[TT4G35G]: Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n- AI can make mistakes. This is a realistic concern.

Data privacy with student information is also a significant worry, as is the risk that AI might recommend teaching methods that aren't pedagogically sound. I'd \"Agree\" with these concerns as well.\n\nMy responses reflect both the genuine benefits AI offers—streamlining administrative work, personalizing instruction, supporting diverse learners—and the legitimate risks educators should consider, from academic integrity issues to algorithmic bias and data security.",
