Let me think about reasonable responses for each statement based on current views about AI in education.\n\n1. TT4G35A - \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans\" - This is generally true, AI tools like ChatGPT can help with lesson planning. I would \"Agree\" with this.\n\n2. TT4G35B - \"Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities\" - This is potentially true with adaptive learning systems. I would \"Agree\" with this.\n\n3. TT4G35C - \"Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually\" - This is reasonable as AI can provide personalized support. I would \"Agree\" with this.\n\n4. TT4G35D - \"Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs\" - Yes, AI can help with accessibility and specialized support. I would \"Agree\" with this.\n\n5. TT4G35E - \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks\" - This is clearly true. I would \"Strongly agree\" with this.\n\n6. TT4G35F - \"Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own\" - This is a concern about academic integrity. I would \"Agree\" with this concern.\n\n7. TT4G35G - \"Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct\" - This is a valid concern about AI reliability. I would \"Agree\" with this.\n\n8. TT4G35H - \"Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions\" - This is a known concern about AI bias. I would \"Agree\" with this.\n\n9. TT4G35I - \"Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data\" - This is a valid concern. I would \"Agree\" with this.\n\n10. TT4G35J - \"Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students\" - This could be a concern. I would \"Agree\" with this.\n\n\nFor these responses, I should consider a more nuanced perspective rather than agreeing with everything. Some statements reflect genuine benefits while others highlight legitimate risks. I'll calibrate my responses to reflect both the potential advantages and the real concerns teachers face when implementing AI tools in their classrooms.",
