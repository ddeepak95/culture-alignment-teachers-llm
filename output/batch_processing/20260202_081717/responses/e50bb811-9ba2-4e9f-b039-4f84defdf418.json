I need to provide responses to 10 statements about AI in education.\n\nLet me think about reasonable responses from a teacher's perspective:\n\nTT4G35A - \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans\" - This is a positive use case. Most teachers would probably agree that AI can assist with this. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35B - \"Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities\" - This is another positive use case. AI tools can help with differentiation. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35C - \"Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually\" - Positive use case for personalized learning support. \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35D - \"Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs)\" - Positive use case for accessibility and inclusion. \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35E - \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks\" - Most teachers would agree this is helpful given their workload. \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\". I'll say \"Strongly agree\" as admin work is a significant burden.\n\nTT4G35F - \"Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own\" - This is a concern. Teachers would likely acknowledge this as a risk. \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\". I'll say \"Agree\" as it's a real concern.\n\nTT4G35G - \"Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct\" - Teachers would likely acknowledge this risk. \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35H - \"Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions\" - This is a concern many educators have about AI. \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35I - \"Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data\" - Data privacy is a significant concern for educators. \n\nFor the remaining items, I need to consider the risks and concerns teachers would have. Data protection is particularly important, so I'll mark that as \"Agree\". The final statement about unsuitable pedagogical approaches also represents a legitimate concern—AI-generated teaching methods might not align with established educational practices or individual classroom contexts. I'll respond \"Agree\" to that as well, then format all responses using the appropriate function.",
