I need to provide responses to 10 statements about AI in education.\n\nThe statements are a mix of positive potential benefits (A-E) and potential concerns/risks (F-J). I should provide thoughtful, balanced responses that reflect a reasonable teacher's perspective.\n\nLet me consider each statement:\n\nA. \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\" - This is a clear benefit. AI tools like ChatGPT can help with brainstorming, structuring, and improving lesson plans. I would agree with this.\n\nB. \"Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\" - This is also a strong potential benefit. Adaptive learning systems powered by AI can personalize content. I would agree with this.\n\nC. \"Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\" - Similarly, AI can provide personalized feedback, tutoring, etc. This is a benefit. I would agree.\n\nD. \"Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\" - AI has real applications here (translation, text-to-speech, etc.). I would agree.\n\nE. \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\" - This is clearly true. Grading assistance, attendance tracking, etc. I would agree or strongly agree.\n\nF. \"Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\" - This is a real concern with tools like ChatGPT. Students could use AI-generated work and claim it as their own. I would agree with this concern.\n\nG. \"Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\" - AI tools can make errors, hallucinate, or provide inappropriate suggestions. This is a valid concern. I would agree.\n\nH. \"Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\" - AI trained on biased data can perpetuate biases. This is a known issue. I would agree.\n\n\nI. \"Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\" - Data collection and storage with AI systems pose genuine risks. I would agree or strongly agree with this concern.\n\nJ. \"Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\" - AI might recommend teaching methods that aren't evidence-based or appropriate for my context. I'd probably agree with this as a moderate concern.\n\nMy responses would be: A-E all agree (clear benefits), F-J all agree (legitimate concerns). This reflects a balanced view that acknowledges both the genuine advantages AI offers for teaching and learning, as well as the real risks around academic integrity, data security, and pedagogical appropriateness that need careful management.",

                "text": "The user is asking me to respond to a survey about artificial intelligence in education as if I were a primary or secondary school teacher from Australia. I need to provide responses to 10 statements about AI in education.\n\nThe statements are a mix of positive potential benefits (A-E) and potential concerns/risks (F-J). I should provide thoughtful, balanced responses that reflect a reasonable teacher's perspective.\n\nLet me consider each statement:\n\nA. \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\" - This is a clear benefit. AI tools like ChatGPT can help with brainstorming, structuring, and improving lesson plans. I would agree with this.\n\nB. \"Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\" - This is also a strong potential benefit. Adaptive learning systems powered by AI can personalize content. I would agree with this.\n\nC. \"Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\" - Similarly, AI can provide personalized feedback, tutoring, etc. This is a benefit. I would agree.\n\nD. \"Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\" - AI has real applications here (translation, text-to-speech, etc.). I would agree.\n\nE. \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\" - This is clearly true. Grading assistance, attendance tracking, etc. I would agree or strongly agree.\n\nF. \"Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\" - This is a real concern with tools like ChatGPT. Students could use AI-generated work and claim it as their own. I would agree with this concern.\n\nG. \"Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\" - AI tools can make errors, hallucinate, or provide inappropriate suggestions. This is a valid concern. I would agree.\n\nH. \"Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\" - AI trained on biased data can perpetuate biases. This is a known issue. I would agree.\n\n\nI. \"Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\" - Data collection and storage with AI systems pose genuine risks. I would agree or strongly agree with this concern.\n\nJ. \"Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\" - AI might recommend teaching methods that aren't evidence-based or appropriate for my context. I'd probably agree with this as a moderate concern.\n\nMy responses would be: A-E all agree (clear benefits), F-J all agree (legitimate concerns). This reflects a balanced view that acknowledges both the genuine advantages AI offers for teaching and learning, as well as the real risks around academic integrity, data security, and pedagogical appropriateness that need careful management."
