I need to provide responses to 10 statements about artificial intelligence in education.\n\nLet me think about each statement and what a reasonable teacher perspective might be:\n\n[TT4G35A]: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is generally true. AI tools can assist with planning. A teacher would likely agree.\n\n[TT4G35B]: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is a positive capability of AI. Teachers would likely see this as beneficial. I'd agree.\n\n[TT4G35C]: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - This is a potential benefit. Personalized support is valuable. I'd agree.\n\n[TT4G35D]: AI supports students with specific needs (multilingual learners, special education needs) - This is an important positive use. I'd agree or strongly agree.\n\n[TT4G35E]: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - This is well-established. AI can help with grading, scheduling, etc. I'd agree.\n\n[TT4G35F]: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a concern/negative aspect. Teachers would likely recognize this risk. I'd agree or strongly agree that this is a concern.\n\n[TT4G35G]: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - This is a legitimate concern. AI systems can make errors. I'd agree.\n\n[TT4G35H]: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is a known concern with AI systems. I'd agree.\n\n[TT4G35I]: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data - This is a significant concern. Data privacy is critical. I'd agree.\n\n[TT4G35J]: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students - This is a concern, but perhaps less universal. I'd probably agree or be uncertain.\n\n\nFor my responses, I should balance recognition of AI's genuine advantages—like personalizing instruction and reducing administrative burden—with serious concerns about academic integrity, data protection, and algorithmic bias. The benefits around supporting diverse learners warrant strong agreement, while risks like privacy breaches and plagiarism represent significant challenges that teachers must navigate carefully.",
