I should consider both the benefits and risks of AI in education and provide thoughtful responses based on realistic educational perspectives.\n\nLet me think through each statement:\n\n[TT4G35A]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\n- This is a reasonable statement. AI tools can help generate ideas, structure lessons, etc. I would say \"Agree\" as this is a practical use case.\n\n[TT4G35B]: Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- This is also reasonable - AI can personalize learning content. \"Agree\" seems appropriate.\n\n[TT4G35C]: Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\n- AI can provide individual tutoring, feedback, etc. \"Agree\" is reasonable.\n\n[TT4G35D]: Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- AI has potential for accessibility and support for diverse learners. \"Agree\" is appropriate.\n\n[TT4G35E]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- This is clearly true - grading, attendance, scheduling, etc. \"Strongly agree\" or \"Agree\" - I'll say \"Agree\" as it's a clear benefit.\n\n[TT4G35F]: Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a risk/concern. AI tools like ChatGPT can be misused for plagiarism. \"Agree\" - this is a real concern.\n\n[TT4G35G]: Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n- AI systems can make errors or inappropriate suggestions. \"Agree\" - this is a known limitation.\n\n[TT4G35H]: Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\n- This is a concern with AI biases. \n\nAI systems can perpetuate existing biases in their training data, which could reinforce incorrect ideas students already hold. Data privacy with student information is a legitimate concern when using AI systems. AI might also recommend teaching methods that aren't suited to particular classroom contexts or student populations.
