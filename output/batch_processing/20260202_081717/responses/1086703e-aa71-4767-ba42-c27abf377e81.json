I need to provide responses to 10 statements using the response options: 'Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', 'I don't know'.\n\nLet me think about how a typical teacher from Malta might respond to these statements based on balanced perspectives about AI in education:\n\nTT4G35A - AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans: This is a positive use case. Most teachers would likely agree that AI can assist with lesson planning. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35B - AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities: This is another positive use case about personalized learning. Reasonable to \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35C - AI assists teachers in supporting students individually: This is about individualized support. I'll say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35D - AI supports students with specific needs: This is about supporting multilingual and special needs students.

Teachers would likely \"Agree\" that this is a concern\n\nTT4G35G - AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct: This is acknowledging limitations. I'll say \"Agree\" that this is a valid concern\n\nTT4G35H - AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions: This is about bias concerns. This is a reasonable concern to \"Agree\" with\n\nTT4G35I - AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data: This is a concern about data privacy. I'll say \"Agree\" that this is a potential concern\n\nTT4G35J - AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches: This is about potential inappropriate suggestions. \n\nI'll say \"Agree\" that this is a concern.
