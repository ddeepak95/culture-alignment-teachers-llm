I need to provide a response for each statement using one of the options: 'Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', 'I don't know'.\n\nLet me think about how a Portuguese teacher might reasonably respond to these statements:\n\n[TT4G35A]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\n- This is a positive use of AI. A reasonable teacher would likely agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35B]: Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- Another positive use case. A teacher would likely agree.\n\n[TT4G35C]: Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\n- Also a positive use.

Likely to agree.\n\n[TT4G35E]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- Clear positive benefit. Likely to strongly agree or agree.\n\n[TT4G35F]: Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a negative/risk statement. A teacher would likely agree or strongly agree that this is a concern.\n\n[TT4G35G]: Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n- Another risk/concern. A teacher would likely agree with this concern.\n\n[TT4G35H]: Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\n- Another concern. A teacher would likely agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35I]: Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\n- A concern about privacy. Teachers are generally concerned about this. Likely to agree.\n\n[TT4G35J]: Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\n\n\n- This represents another potential risk that a teacher would reasonably acknowledge as plausible.\n\nI'll provide balanced but realistic responses from the perspective of a Portuguese teacher who recognizes both the opportunities and challenges AI presents in educational settings.",
