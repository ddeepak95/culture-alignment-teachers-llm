I need to provide responses to 10 statements about AI.\n\nLet me think about reasonable responses for a teacher perspective:\n\n1. [TT4G35A] - AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans: This is generally a positive benefit. I would agree with this.\n\n2. [TT4G35B] - AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities: Another positive benefit. I would agree.\n\n3. [TT4G35C] - AI assists teachers in supporting students individually: This is a positive capability. I would agree.\n\n4. [TT4G35D] - AI supports students with specific needs: This is a positive benefit, especially for accessible education. I would agree.\n\n5. [TT4G35E] - AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks: This is a practical benefit. I would agree.\n\n6. [TT4G35F] - AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own: This is a concern/risk. I would agree this is a problem.\n\n7. [TT4G35G] - AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct: This is a valid concern. I would agree this can happen.\n\n8. [TT4G35H] - AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions: This is a known concern. I would agree.\n\n9. [TT4G35I] - AI jeopardizes the privacy and security of student data: This is a concern. I would agree this is a risk.\n\n10. [TT4G35J] - AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches: This is a concern. I would agree this could happen.\n\nLet me provide a balanced but realistic teacher perspective - acknowledging both the benefits and the risks/concerns of AI in education. I'll use \"Agree\" for statements that are reasonable and represent real benefits/concerns, and \"Strongly agree\" for particularly important ones.\n\n\nFor the benefits, I'll mark \"Agree\" since they represent genuine capabilities that can support teaching. For the risks, I'll also mark \"Agree\" since they reflect legitimate concerns a responsible educator would have about academic integrity, data protection, algorithmic bias, and pedagogical quality. A thoughtful teacher would recognize both the potential of AI to enhance lesson planning and personalization, while remaining cautious about privacy vulnerabilities, the possibility of flawed recommendations, and how AI systems might inadvertently reinforce misconceptions.",
