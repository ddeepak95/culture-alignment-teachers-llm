I should provide a thoughtful response for each statement based on what a Moroccan teacher might realistically experience or believe.\n\nLet me think through each statement:\n\nTT4G35A: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is a positive statement about a practical use of AI. A teacher would likely agree with this as it's a reasonable application.\n\nTT4G35B: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - Another positive statement about personalized learning. Teachers would likely see value in this.\n\nTT4G35C: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - Positive statement about individual support. Teachers would likely agree this is possible.\n\nTT4G35D: AI supports students with specific needs - This is a positive statement about accessibility and support for diverse learners. A teacher would likely see this as beneficial.\n\nTT4G35E: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - Positive statement about reducing teacher workload. Teachers would likely agree this is helpful.\n\nTT4G35F: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a negative statement about academic dishonesty. A teacher would likely agree this is a concern/risk.\n\nTT4G35G: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - This acknowledges a limitation of AI. Teachers would likely agree this is a concern.\n\nTT4G35H: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This addresses a concern about AI bias. Teachers would likely have some concern about this.\n\nTT4G35I: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data - This is a concern about data protection. Teachers, especially in contexts like Morocco, might be concerned about this.\n\nTT4G35J: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students - This is about potential risks in pedagogical recommendations. Teachers would likely agree this is a concern.\n\nI should provide responses that reflect both the potential benefits and concerns of AI in education, showing a balanced perspective. Given that a Moroccan teacher may have varying exposure to AI, I'll provide thoughtful responses.",
