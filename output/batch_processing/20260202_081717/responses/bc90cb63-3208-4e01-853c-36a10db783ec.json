Let me consider each statement carefully:\n\n[TT4G35A]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\n- This is a reasonable positive statement about AI's capabilities. I would Agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35B]: Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- This is also reasonable and a known capability of AI. I would Agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35C]: Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\n- Personalized learning is a known strength of AI. I would Agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35D]: Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- This is a strength of AI and matches the examples given. I would Agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35E]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- This is a clear use case of AI. I would Strongly agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35F]: Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a concern about AI/plagiarism. As a teacher, I would be concerned but this is more about how students might misuse it. I would Agree that this is a potential issue.\n\n[TT4G35G]: Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n- This is a valid concern about AI accuracy and appropriateness. I would Agree with this concern.\n\n[TT4G35H]: Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\n- This is a known concern about AI. I would Agree with this risk.\n\n[TT4G35I]: Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\n- This is a legitimate concern for teachers. I would Agree with this concern.\n\n\n- \n[TT4G35J]: Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\n- AI recommendations might not always align with sound teaching practices. I would Agree with this concern as well.",
