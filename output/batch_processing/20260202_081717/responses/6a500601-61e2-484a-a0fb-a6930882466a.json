I need to provide responses to 10 statements about AI's potential benefits and risks.\n\nLet me consider each statement thoughtfully as a Portuguese teacher would:\n\n[TT4G35A]: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\n- This is definitely true. AI tools can assist in generating content ideas, structuring lessons, etc. I would agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35B]: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- Yes, AI can help with personalization and differentiation of content. This is a valid benefit. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35C]: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually.\n- Yes, AI can provide personalized feedback, tutoring support, etc. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35D]: AI supports students with specific needs (e.g., multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- Yes, AI can assist with accessibility features, translation, specialized learning supports. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35E]: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- Yes, AI can help with grading, scheduling, record-keeping, etc. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35F]: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a concern - students could use AI to generate work and pass it off as their own. This is a real risk. I would agree with this concern.\n\n[TT4G35G]: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n- Yes, AI systems can make errors or provide inappropriate recommendations. This is a valid concern. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35H]: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\n- This is a concern about bias in AI systems. It's a valid worry. I would agree.\n\n[TT4G35I]: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\n- This is a legitimate concern about data protection and privacy. I would agree.\n  \n[TT4G35J]: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\n- AI might recommend teaching methods that don't align with sound educational practice. This is worth considering carefully. I would agree this is a risk.\n\nI recognize both the genuine advantages AI offers for instruction and support, as well as the legitimate concerns around academic integrity, data safety, and pedagogical appropriateness.
