I would say \"Agree\" - AI can definitely help with this.\n\n2. **TT4G35B**: \"Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\" - This is also a positive application. I would say \"Agree\" - AI has potential for personalization.\n\n3. **TT4G35C**: \"Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\" - Another positive application. I would say \"Agree\" - AI can support individual attention.\n\n4. **TT4G35D**: \"Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\" - This is positive and realistic. I would say \"Agree\" - AI tools can indeed help with accessibility.\n\n5. **TT4G35E**: \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\" - This is very realistic and positive. I would say \"Strongly agree\" - this is one of the clearest use cases.\n\n6. **TT4G35F**: \"Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\" - This is a concern/risk. I would say \"Agree\" - this is a real concern with AI like ChatGPT.\n\n7. **TT4G35G**: \"Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\" - This is a realistic concern. I would say \"Agree\" - AI can make errors or unsuitable recommendations.\n\n8. **TT4G35H**: \"Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\" - This is a concern about bias. I would say \"Agree\" - this is a known issue with AI systems.\n   \nFor the remaining concerns, data privacy with AI systems is a legitimate worry, so I'd mark that as \"Agree\" as well. Similarly, AI might suggest pedagogical approaches that don't align with sound teaching practices, which is another valid concern worth acknowledging. This gives a balanced perspective that recognizes both the genuine educational benefits AI can offer and the real risks that need to be managed.",
