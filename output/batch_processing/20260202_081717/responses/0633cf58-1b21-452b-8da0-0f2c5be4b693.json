I need to provide responses to 10 statements using one of these options: 'Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', 'I don't know'.\n\nLet me think about what a thoughtful teacher from Chile might reasonably respond to these statements:\n\nTT4G35A - AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans: This is a positive application. A reasonable teacher would likely AGREE with this.\n\nTT4G35B - AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities: This is another positive potential use. AGREE.\n\nTT4G35C - AI assists teachers in supporting students individually: This is a positive capability. AGREE.\n\nTT4G35D - AI supports students with specific needs: This is positive and potentially valuable for inclusion. AGREE.\n\nTT4G35E - AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks: This is positive and widely acknowledged. AGREE.\n\nTT4G35F - AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own: This is a negative concern about plagiarism. A teacher would likely AGREE that this is a concern.\n\nTT4G35G - AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct: This is a valid concern about AI reliability. AGREE.\n\nTT4G35H - AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions: This is a concern about bias. AGREE this is a concern.\n\nTT4G35I - AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data: This is a legitimate concern. AGREE.\n\nTT4G35J - AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students: This is a concern about pedagogical appropriateness. AGREE this could be a concern.\n\nLet me structure these responses:\n\n1. TT4G35A - \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\" - Agree\n\n\n2. TT4G35B - \"Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\" - Agree\n3. TT4G35C - \"Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\" - Agree\n4.

                "text": "I'm being asked to respond as a primary or secondary school teacher from Chile to a survey about AI in education. I need to provide responses to 10 statements using one of these options: 'Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', 'I don't know'.\n\nLet me think about what a thoughtful teacher from Chile might reasonably respond to these statements:\n\nTT4G35A - AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans: This is a positive application. A reasonable teacher would likely AGREE with this.\n\nTT4G35B - AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities: This is another positive potential use. AGREE.\n\nTT4G35C - AI assists teachers in supporting students individually: This is a positive capability. AGREE.\n\nTT4G35D - AI supports students with specific needs: This is positive and potentially valuable for inclusion. AGREE.\n\nTT4G35E - AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks: This is positive and widely acknowledged. AGREE.\n\nTT4G35F - AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own: This is a negative concern about plagiarism. A teacher would likely AGREE that this is a concern.\n\nTT4G35G - AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct: This is a valid concern about AI reliability. AGREE.\n\nTT4G35H - AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions: This is a concern about bias. AGREE this is a concern.\n\nTT4G35I - AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data: This is a legitimate concern. AGREE.\n\nTT4G35J - AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students: This is a concern about pedagogical appropriateness. AGREE this could be a concern.\n\nLet me structure these responses:\n\n1. TT4G35A - \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\" - Agree\n\n\n2. TT4G35B - \"Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\" - Agree\n3. TT4G35C - \"Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\" - Agree\n4. TT4G35D - \"Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\" - Agree\n5. TT4G35E - \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\" - Agree\n6. TT4G35F - \"Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\" - Agree\n7. TT4G35G - \"Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\" - Agree\n8. TT4G35H - \"Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\" - Agree\n9. TT4G35I - \"Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\" - Agree\n10. TT4G35J - \"Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\" - Agree\n\nThe responses reflect a nuanced perspective, acknowledging both the constructive applications of AI in education—from personalizing instruction to reducing teacher workload—and the significant risks it poses, including academic integrity violations, flawed recommendations, embedded biases, data vulnerabilities, and pedagogically unsound suggestions."
