Let me think through each one carefully based on my knowledge and experience perspective:\n\n[TT4G35A]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\n- This is generally true. AI tools like ChatGPT can help generate lesson plan ideas, structure, and content. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35B]: Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- AI can personalize learning and adapt content to different levels. This is a known benefit. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35C]: Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\n- AI can provide tutoring, feedback, and individualized support. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35D]: Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- AI has real potential for accessibility and translation tools. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35E]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- This is definitely true - grading, organizing data, etc. I would say \"Strongly agree\"\n\n[TT4G35F]: Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a known risk - plagiarism, using AI-generated work. I would say \"Agree\" - this is a real concern\n\n[TT4G35G]: Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n- AI can make errors, hallucinations, inappropriate suggestions. I would say \"Agree\" - this is a legitimate concern\n\n[TT4G35H]: Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\n- This is a documented concern with AI. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35I]: Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\n\n\n- Data handling and privacy protection are significant concerns depending on implementation. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35J]: Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\n- Teachers might uncritically adopt AI recommendations without considering their classroom context. I would say \"Agree\"\n\nAs a teacher, I recognize both the genuine advantages AI offers for lesson preparation and personalized learning, as well as the legitimate risks around data security, bias, and the potential for inappropriate suggestions if used without critical judgment.",
