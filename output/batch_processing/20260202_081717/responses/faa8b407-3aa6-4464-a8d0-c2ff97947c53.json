I need to provide responses to 10 statements about AI in education.\n\nLet me think about how a thoughtful educator from South Africa might respond to these statements, balancing both the positive potential and genuine concerns about AI in education.\n\nThe statements fall into two categories:\n- Positive/beneficial uses of AI (A, B, C, D, E)\n- Negative/concerning uses or risks of AI (F, G, H, I, J)\n\nFor a teacher perspective, I should:\n1. Acknowledge the real benefits AI can bring to education (statements A-E)\n2. Acknowledge genuine concerns and risks (statements F-J)\n3. Be balanced and realistic\n\nLet me provide responses:\n\nA) Helps write/improve lesson plans - A teacher would likely agree this is possible, though might want to note it needs oversight. I'd say \"Agree\" - AI tools can definitely help with this.\n\nB) Adapt learning material to different abilities - This is a strong potential benefit. \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\" - this is a real capability of AI.\n\nC) Support students individually - This is a significant potential benefit. \"Agree\" - AI can provide personalized support.\n\nD) Support students with specific needs - \"Agree\" - AI has potential here for accessibility.\n\nE) Automate administrative tasks - \"Agree\" - this is clearly something AI can do and would benefit teachers.\n\nF) Enable students to misrepresent work - \"Strongly agree\" - this is a real risk that teachers face daily. This is a genuine concern.\n\nG) Recommendations not appropriate/correct - \"Agree\" - AI tools can make errors and inappropriate suggestions.\n\nH) Amplifies biases/misconceptions - \"Agree\" - this is a documented concern with AI systems.\n\nI) Jeopardizes privacy/security - \"Agree\" - this is a legitimate concern about data protection.\n\nJ) Suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches - \"Agree\" - AI may not always suggest educationally sound methods.\n\n\nI should calibrate these responses to reflect a realistic educator's perspective. The positive applications warrant agreement, while the risks are genuine enough to warrant caution. I need to be honest about both the opportunities and the legitimate challenges that come with integrating AI into classrooms.",
