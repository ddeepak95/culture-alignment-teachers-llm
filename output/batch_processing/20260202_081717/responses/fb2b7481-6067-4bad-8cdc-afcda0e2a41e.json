I should provide thoughtful, balanced responses that reflect a teacher's perspective on both the benefits and risks of AI.\n\nLet me go through each statement:\n\nTT4G35A: \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\" - This is a positive use case. AI tools can assist with lesson planning. I would say \"Agree\" - AI can help with this.\n\nTT4G35B: \"Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\" - AI can personalize learning. This is a known capability. I would say \"Agree\".\n\nTT4G35C: \"Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\" - AI can provide individualized support. I would say \"Agree\".\n\nTT4G35D: \"Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\" - AI has potential here but also limitations. I think \"Agree\" is reasonable as AI can help with accessibility features.\n\nTT4G35E: \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\" - This is clearly true. AI can help with grading, attendance, scheduling, etc. I would say \"Strongly agree\".\n\nTT4G35F: \"Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\" - This is a risk. AI tools can be used for plagiarism/academic dishonesty. I would say \"Agree\" - this is a real concern.\n\nTT4G35G: \"Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\" - AI is not perfect and can make errors. I would say \"Agree\".\n\nTT4G35H: \"Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\" - This is a concern about AI bias. I would say \"Agree\" - this is a known issue.\n\nTT4G35I: \"Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\" - Data privacy is a major concern with AI systems. \n\nData protection is indeed a significant risk when implementing AI in schools. For TT4G35J, AI systems might recommend teaching methods that don't align with sound pedagogical principles, so I'd also say \"Agree\" there. Let me finalize these responses for submission.",
