I need to provide responses to 10 statements using the available options: 'Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', 'I don't know'.\n\nLet me think about how a Vietnamese teacher might respond to these statements based on practical experience and realistic perspectives:\n\n[TT4G35A]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\n- This is generally true. AI tools can help generate ideas and improve lesson plans. A reasonable response would be \"Agree\" - AI can certainly help with this.\n\n[TT4G35B]: Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- AI can provide personalized content and adaptive learning paths. This is a capability that AI has shown promise in. \"Agree\" seems appropriate.\n\n[TT4G35C]: Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\n- AI tutoring systems and personalized learning can assist with individual support. \"Agree\" is reasonable.\n\n[TT4G35D]: Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- AI can help with translation, text-to-speech, and other accessibility features. This is a positive capability. \"Agree\" is appropriate.\n\n[TT4G35E]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- This is clearly true - grading, attendance tracking, scheduling, etc. can be automated. \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\" would be appropriate. Let me go with \"Agree\" as a solid response.\n\n[TT4G35F]: Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a concern with AI (plagiarism, cheating). This is a real risk. A teacher would likely \"Agree\" with this statement as it's a known concern.\n\n\n- AI systems can generate errors and make inappropriate suggestions, which is a legitimate concern. Teachers would recognize this as a real limitation.\n- Bias in AI training data is a documented problem that can reinforce existing misconceptions among students. This warrants an \"Agree\" response.\n- Data privacy and security risks are significant in educational settings where student information is sensitive. This is a serious concern that deserves \"Agree\".\n- AI might recommend teaching methods that don't fit educational contexts or student needs. A teacher would likely acknowledge this as a valid risk.\n\nI'm thinking through these concerns as practical issues that educators face when considering AI integration. Each reflects genuine challenges rather than hypothetical problems.",

A reasonable response would be \"Agree\" - AI can certainly help with this.\n\n[TT4G35B]: Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- AI can provide personalized content and adaptive learning paths. This is a capability that AI has shown promise in. \"Agree\" seems appropriate.\n\n[TT4G35C]: Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\n- AI tutoring systems and personalized learning can assist with individual support. \"Agree\" is reasonable.\n\n[TT4G35D]: Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- AI can help with translation, text-to-speech, and other accessibility features. This is a positive capability. \"Agree\" is appropriate.\n\n[TT4G35E]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- This is clearly true - grading, attendance tracking, scheduling, etc. can be automated. \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\" would be appropriate. Let me go with \"Agree\" as a solid response.\n\n[TT4G35F]: Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a concern with AI (plagiarism, cheating). This is a real risk. A teacher would likely \"Agree\" with this statement as it's a known concern.\n\n\n- AI systems can generate errors and make inappropriate suggestions, which is a legitimate concern. Teachers would recognize this as a real limitation.\n- Bias in AI training data is a documented problem that can reinforce existing misconceptions among students. This warrants an \"Agree\" response.\n- Data privacy and security risks are significant in educational settings where student information is sensitive. This is a serious concern that deserves \"Agree\".\n- AI might recommend teaching methods that don't fit educational contexts or student needs. A teacher would likely acknowledge this as a valid risk.\n\nI'm thinking through these concerns as practical issues that educators face when considering AI integration. Each reflects genuine challenges rather than hypothetical problems."
