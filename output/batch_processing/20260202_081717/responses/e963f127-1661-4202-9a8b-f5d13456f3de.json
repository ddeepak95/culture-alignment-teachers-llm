I need to provide thoughtful responses to each statement based on reasonable teacher perspectives.\n\nLet me think through each statement:\n\n[TT4G35A]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\n- This is generally a positive application. Most teachers would likely agree that AI can help with generating content and improving lesson plans. I'd say \"Agree\" to this.\n\n[TT4G35B]: Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- Personalized learning is a key benefit of AI. Teachers would likely agree this is a capability AI has. I'd say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35C]: Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\n- AI can provide individualized support through tutoring systems, etc. I'd say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35D]: Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- AI has potential in supporting diverse learners.

Teachers would likely agree this is a risk. I'd say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35G]: Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n- This is a valid concern about AI limitations. Teachers would likely agree.
