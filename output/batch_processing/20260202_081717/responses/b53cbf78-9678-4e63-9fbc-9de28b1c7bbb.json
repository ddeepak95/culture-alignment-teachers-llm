        "reasoning_content": "I need to respond to each of these 10 statements about AI in education as if I were a primary or secondary school teacher from Flemish Belgium. I need to provide thoughtful responses that reflect a balanced perspective on both the benefits and potential risks of AI in educational contexts.\n\nLet me consider each statement:\n\n[TT4G35A]: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is generally true. AI tools can assist in generating ideas, structures, and improving lesson plans. I would agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35B]: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is also true. AI can personalize content based on student performance and needs. I would agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35C]: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - True, AI can provide personalized feedback and support. I would agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35D]: AI supports students with specific needs - Yes, AI can help with multilingual learners and special education needs through personalization and adapted content. I would agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35E]: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - True, AI can handle grading, attendance, scheduling, etc. I would agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35F]: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a concern. AI tools like ChatGPT can be used for plagiarism. As a teacher, I would agree this is a real risk.\n\n[TT4G35G]: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - Yes, AI can make errors or inappropriate suggestions. I would agree with this concern.\n\n[TT4G35H]: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is a known issue with AI. I would agree this is a concern.\n\n[TT4G35I]: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data - This is a valid concern. Data privacy is important. I would agree this is a risk.\n\n[TT4G35J]: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches - This could happen if AI is trained on or generates pedagogically flawed approaches. \n\nI would agree this is a potential concern. As a teacher, I recognize both the genuine advantages AI offers—from streamlining administrative work to personalizing instruction for diverse learners—and the legitimate risks it poses, particularly around academic integrity, data protection, and the quality of AI-generated recommendations. My perspective would balance cautious optimism about the benefits with vigilance about the pitfalls.",
