I need to provide responses to 10 statements using the available response options: 'Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', 'I don't know'.\n\nLet me think about reasonable responses from a teacher's perspective:\n\n[TT4G35A]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\n- This is a positive use case that many teachers can see value in. Response: Agree\n\n[TT4G35B]: Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- This is also a positive capability that AI could provide. Response: Agree\n\n[TT4G35C]: Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\n- Another positive use case. Response: Agree\n\n[TT4G35D]: Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- This is a valuable application. Response: Agree\n\n[TT4G35E]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- This is widely recognized as a benefit. Response: Strongly agree\n\n[TT4G35F]: Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a concern/risk. Response: Agree (teachers would likely agree this is a risk)\n\n[TT4G35G]: Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n- This is a legitimate concern. Response: Agree\n\n[TT4G35H]: Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\n- This is a known concern about AI. Response: Agree\n\n[TT4G35I]: Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\n- This is a concern many educators have. Response: Agree\n\n[TT4G35J]: Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\n\n\n- This is a reasonable concern. Response: Agree\n\nI'm aiming for a balanced perspective that recognizes both the genuine benefits AI offers in lesson planning, personalization, and administrative efficiency, while also acknowledging the real risks around academic integrity, data security, and potential biases in AI recommendations.",
