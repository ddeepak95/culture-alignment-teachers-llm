I need to provide responses to each of the 10 statements using the available response options: ['Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', 'I don't know']\n\nLet me think about reasonable responses from a teacher's perspective:\n\nTT4G35A - AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans: This is generally true - many teachers find AI tools helpful for brainstorming and improving lesson plans. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35B - AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities: This is also generally true - AI can personalize content. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35C - AI assists teachers in supporting students individually: Personalized learning systems can do this. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35D - AI supports students with specific needs: AI can help with multilingual support and accessibility features. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35E - AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks: Yes, definitely - grading, attendance, etc. I'd say \"Strongly agree\"\n\nTT4G35F - AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own: This is a concern - plagiarism with AI. I'd say \"Agree\" (this is a negative aspect but it's a real concern)\n\nTT4G35G - AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct: This is a valid concern. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35H - AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions: This is a documented concern. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35I - AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data: This is a significant concern for educators. I'd say \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35J - AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches: This could happen. I'd say \"Disagree\" - I think most AI systems try to suggest evidence-based approaches, but I could see this happening sometimes. Actually, let me reconsider - I'd say \"Agree\" because it's a possibility.\n\n\nI should provide responses that acknowledge both the genuine benefits AI offers in classroom settings and the legitimate risks educators need to consider. The positive applications around lesson planning, personalization, and administrative efficiency are clear, but the concerns about data security, bias, and academic integrity are equally important to recognize.",
