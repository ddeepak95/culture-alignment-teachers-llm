I need to provide responses to 10 statements about artificial intelligence in education.\n\nLet me think about each statement from the perspective of a thoughtful educator in Morocco:\n\n[TT4G35A]: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\n- This is a positive statement. AI tools can definitely help with lesson planning. I would \"Agree\" with this.\n\n[TT4G35B]: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- This is also positive and reflects real capabilities of AI.

I would \"Agree\" with this.\n\n[TT4G35D]: AI supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- This is positive and reflects AI's potential. I would \"Agree\" with this.\n\n[TT4G35E]: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- Positive statement about automation of routine tasks. I would \"Agree\" with this.\n\n[TT4G35F]: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a negative statement about academic dishonesty. This is a real concern. I would \"Agree\" with this concern (the statement is true that AI enables this).\n\n[TT4G35G]: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n- This is a valid concern about AI limitations. I would \"Agree\" with this.\n\n[TT4G35H]: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\n- This is a concern about bias in AI. This is a valid concern. I would \"Agree\" with this.\n\n[TT4G35I]: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\n\n\n- Data security is a legitimate concern I would \"Agree\" with.\n\n[TT4G35J]: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\n- This is a potential risk worth acknowledging. I would \"Agree\" with this as well.\n\nAs an educator, I recognize both the genuine advantages AI offers—from streamlining lesson preparation to personalizing instruction—and the real risks it poses, particularly around academic integrity, data protection, and algorithmic bias.
