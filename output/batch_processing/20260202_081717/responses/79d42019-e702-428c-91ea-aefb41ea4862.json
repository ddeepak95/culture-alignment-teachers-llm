I'd agree this is a problem.\n\n[TT4G35G]: Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n- This is a concern about AI accuracy/appropriateness. As an educator, I know AI isn't perfect. I'd agree.\n\n[TT4G35H]: Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\n- This is a concern about bias in AI. This is a legitimate concern. I'd agree.\n\n[TT4G35I]: Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\n- This is a concern about data security and privacy. As a teacher concerned with student welfare, I'd agree this is a concern.\n  \n[TT4G35J]: Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\n- This raises concerns about whether AI recommendations align with sound teaching practices. I'd agree this is something to watch for.\n\nLooking at all these statements, I recognize both the genuine advantages AI offers for lesson planning, differentiation, and administrative relief, as well as the real risks around academic integrity, data security, bias, and pedagogical soundness. My responses should reflect this balanced perspective—acknowledging the benefits while taking the concerns seriously."
