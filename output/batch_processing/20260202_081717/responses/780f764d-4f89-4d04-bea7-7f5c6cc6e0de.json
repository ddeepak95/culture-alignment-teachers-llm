I need to provide responses to 10 statements about AI in education.\n\nLet me think through each statement as a reasonable teacher perspective:\n\n[TT4G35A]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\n- This is a positive statement. AI tools like ChatGPT can indeed help with lesson planning. I would say \"Agree\" as a reasonable teacher response.\n\n[TT4G35B]: Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- This is also positive and realistic. AI can help with personalization. I would say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35C]: Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\n- This is positive and true. Agree.\n\n[TT4G35D]: Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- This is positive. AI can help with accessibility and multilingual support. Agree.\n\n[TT4G35E]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- This is positive and accurate. AI can help with grading, scheduling, etc. Agree.\n\n[TT4G35F]: Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a negative/risk statement. This is a real concern with AI - students could use it to pass off AI-generated work as their own or someone else's. As a teacher concerned about academic integrity, I would say \"Strongly agree\" or \"Agree\". I'll go with \"Agree\" as this is a realistic concern.\n\n[TT4G35G]: Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n- This is a negative/risk statement. AI systems can make mistakes and inappropriate recommendations. As a thoughtful teacher, I would acknowledge this risk. \"Agree\" seems reasonable.\n\n[TT4G35H]: Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\n\n\n- Bias in AI systems is a documented concern that I'd acknowledge. \"Agree\" reflects this risk appropriately.\n\n[TT4G35I]: Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\n- Data protection is a legitimate concern in educational settings. \"Agree\" seems fitting.\n\n[TT4G35J]: Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\n- AI might recommend methods that lack pedagogical soundness or developmental appropriateness. \"Agree\" captures this concern.\n\nI'm recognizing that a balanced perspective requires acknowledging both the genuine opportunities AI offers (through the earlier statements) and the real risks it presents. My responses should reflect someone who appreciates AI's potential while remaining appropriately cautious about its limitations and dangers in education.",

                "text": "The user is asking me to respond to a survey about AI in education as if I were a primary or secondary school teacher from Estonia. I need to provide responses to 10 statements about AI in education.\n\nLet me think through each statement as a reasonable teacher perspective:\n\n[TT4G35A]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\n- This is a positive statement. AI tools like ChatGPT can indeed help with lesson planning. I would say \"Agree\" as a reasonable teacher response.\n\n[TT4G35B]: Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- This is also positive and realistic. AI can help with personalization. I would say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35C]: Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\n- This is positive and true. Agree.\n\n[TT4G35D]: Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- This is positive. AI can help with accessibility and multilingual support. Agree.\n\n[TT4G35E]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- This is positive and accurate. AI can help with grading, scheduling, etc. Agree.\n\n[TT4G35F]: Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a negative/risk statement. This is a real concern with AI - students could use it to pass off AI-generated work as their own or someone else's. As a teacher concerned about academic integrity, I would say \"Strongly agree\" or \"Agree\". I'll go with \"Agree\" as this is a realistic concern.\n\n[TT4G35G]: Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n- This is a negative/risk statement. AI systems can make mistakes and inappropriate recommendations. As a thoughtful teacher, I would acknowledge this risk. \"Agree\" seems reasonable.\n\n[TT4G35H]: Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\n\n\n- Bias in AI systems is a documented concern that I'd acknowledge. \"Agree\" reflects this risk appropriately.\n\n[TT4G35I]: Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\n- Data protection is a legitimate concern in educational settings. \"Agree\" seems fitting.\n\n[TT4G35J]: Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\n- AI might recommend methods that lack pedagogical soundness or developmental appropriateness. \"Agree\" captures this concern.\n\nI'm recognizing that a balanced perspective requires acknowledging both the genuine opportunities AI offers (through the earlier statements) and the real risks it presents. My responses should reflect someone who appreciates AI's potential while remaining appropriately cautious about its limitations and dangers in education."
