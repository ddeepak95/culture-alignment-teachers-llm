I need to provide responses to all 10 statements using the available response options: 'Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', or 'I don't know'.\n\nLet me think through each statement carefully:\n\n[TT4G35A]: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans. - This is a reasonable positive use. I would say \"Agree\" as AI tools can definitely help with lesson planning.\n\n[TT4G35B]: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities. - This is also a positive capability. I would say \"Agree\" as AI can help personalize content.\n\n[TT4G35C]: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually. - This is another positive use. I would say \"Agree\" as AI can provide personalized support.\n\n[TT4G35D]: AI supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs). - This is positive and important. I would say \"Agree\" as AI can be very helpful for accessibility and inclusion.\n\n[TT4G35E]: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks. - This is clearly true and positive. I would say \"Strongly agree\" as this is a well-established benefit.\n\n[TT4G35F]: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own. - This is a concern/negative statement. I would say \"Agree\" as this is a real risk that exists with AI tools like chat-based systems.\n\n[TT4G35G]: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct. - This is also a concern. I would say \"Agree\" as AI systems can indeed make mistakes or give inappropriate suggestions.\n\n[TT4G35H]: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions. - This is a concern about bias. I would say \"Agree\" as this is a known issue with AI systems trained on biased data.\n\n\nData privacy represents a genuine risk when implementing AI in schools, so I'd agree with that concern. Similarly, AI systems may recommend teaching methods that don't align with sound pedagogical practice or local educational contexts, which is worth acknowledging as a potential drawback.",
