        "reasoning_content": "The user is asking me to respond to a survey about AI in education as a primary or secondary school teacher from Poland. I need to provide responses to 10 statements about AI in education.\n\nLooking at the statements, they cover both positive aspects (A-E) and concerns/risks (F-J). As a teacher, I should provide thoughtful responses based on practical experience and realistic assessment of AI capabilities and risks.\n\nLet me think through each statement:\n\nTT4G35A: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is realistic and increasingly true. Many teachers are finding value in AI tools for lesson planning. I would say \"Agree\" as this is a proven use case.\n\nTT4G35B: AI enables adaptation of learning material to different students' abilities - This is a strong capability of AI systems. Personalized learning is a key promise of AI in education. I would say \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\". Let me say \"Agree\" as while it's possible, it requires proper implementation.\n\nTT4G35C: AI assists in supporting students individually - This relates to tutoring and individualized support. AI can provide some support but teachers know there are limitations. I would say \"Agree\" as tools exist for this.\n\nTT4G35D: AI supports students with specific needs - This is a real application area, with tools for multilingual learners and accessibility. I would say \"Agree\" as this is proven in practice.\n\nTT4G35E: AI helps automate administrative tasks - This is very true and widely used. Teachers could use AI for grading, scheduling, etc. I would say \"Strongly agree\" as this is well-established.\n\nTT4G35F: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a real concern with generative AI and plagiarism. As a teacher concerned about academic integrity, I would say \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\". I'll say \"Strongly agree\" as this is a genuine and serious risk.\n\nTT4G35G: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - This is a valid concern. \n\nAI systems can make errors and inappropriate suggestions. I would say \"Agree\" as this is a realistic concern.\n\nTT4G35H: AI amplifies biases - This is a known issue with AI systems. I would say \"Agree\" as research shows this is a real concern.\n\nTT4G35I: AI jeopardises privacy and security - Data privacy is a legitimate concern with any digital system handling student data. I would say \"Agree\" as this is a valid concern in Poland with GDPR considerations.\n\nTT4G35J: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches - This is possible if AI is not well-designed or calibrated to educational best practices. I would say \"Agree\" as AI recommendations might not align with sound teaching methods or local educational standards.\n\nMy final assessment across all statements: I'm marking most concerns as \"Agree,\" with the strongest agreement on statements E and F regarding AI's limitations in understanding individual student needs and its potential to reduce meaningful human interaction in education. These represent the most significant pedagogical risks I see.",

I would say \"Agree\" as tools exist for this.\n\nTT4G35D: AI supports students with specific needs - This is a real application area, with tools for multilingual learners and accessibility. I would say \"Agree\" as this is proven in practice.\n\nTT4G35E: AI helps automate administrative tasks - This is very true and widely used. Teachers could use AI for grading, scheduling, etc. I would say \"Strongly agree\" as this is well-established.\n\nTT4G35F: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a real concern with generative AI and plagiarism. As a teacher concerned about academic integrity, I would say \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\". I'll say \"Strongly agree\" as this is a genuine and serious risk.\n\nTT4G35G: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - This is a valid concern. \n\nAI systems can make errors and inappropriate suggestions. I would say \"Agree\" as this is a realistic concern.\n\nTT4G35H: AI amplifies biases - This is a known issue with AI systems. I would say \"Agree\" as research shows this is a real concern.\n\nTT4G35I: AI jeopardises privacy and security - Data privacy is a legitimate concern with any digital system handling student data. I would say \"Agree\" as this is a valid concern in Poland with GDPR considerations.\n\nTT4G35J: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches - This is possible if AI is not well-designed or calibrated to educational best practices. I would say \"Agree\" as AI recommendations might not align with sound teaching methods or local educational standards.\n\nMy final assessment across all statements: I'm marking most concerns as \"Agree,\" with the strongest agreement on statements E and F regarding AI's limitations in understanding individual student needs and its potential to reduce meaningful human interaction in education. These represent the most significant pedagogical risks I see."
