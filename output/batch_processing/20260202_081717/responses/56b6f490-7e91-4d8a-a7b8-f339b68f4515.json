I need to provide thoughtful responses to each statement based on my understanding of AI in educational contexts. These statements cover both potential benefits and concerns about AI in education.\n\nLet me think about each statement and provide reasonable responses:\n\n[TT4G35A]: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is generally true. AI tools can assist with brainstorming, organizing content, and suggesting improvements. I would **Agree** with this.\n\n[TT4G35B]: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is also true. AI can analyze student performance and suggest adaptations. I would **Agree** with this.\n\n[TT4G35C]: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - This is true with tools like personalized learning platforms. I would **Agree** with this.\n\n[TT4G35D]: AI supports students with specific needs - AI can provide support for multilingual learners and students with special needs. I would **Agree** with this.\n\n[TT4G35E]: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - This is clearly true. AI can handle grading, attendance, etc. I would **Strongly agree** with this.\n\n[TT4G35F]: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a concern about AI misuse/academic integrity. This is a valid concern. I would **Agree** with this statement acknowledging the concern.\n\n[TT4G35G]: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - This is a valid concern about AI limitations. I would **Agree** with this.\n\n[TT4G35H]: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is a concern but I should be balanced. AI can have biases but it's not certain it \"amplifies\" them. I would **Agree** that this is a concern.\n\n[TT4G35I]: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data - This is a legitimate concern with data handling. I would **Agree** with this concern.\n\n\n[TT4G35J]: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches - This is also a concern depending on how the system is configured and trained. I would **Agree** that this represents a real risk.\n\nI'll provide these responses using the json_tool_call function.",
