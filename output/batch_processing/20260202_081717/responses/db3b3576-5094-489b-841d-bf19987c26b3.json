I need to provide responses to 10 statements about AI in education.\n\nLet me think about reasonable responses from a teacher's perspective:\n\n1. [TT4G35A]: \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\" - This is generally a positive application. I would say \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\" as AI tools can indeed help with lesson planning.\n\n2.

A teacher would likely \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\" that this is a real concern/risk.\n\n7.
