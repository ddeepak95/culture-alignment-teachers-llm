I should provide thoughtful, reasonable responses based on what a typical educator might think about these topics.\n\nLet me think about each statement:\n\n[TT4G35A]: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is a positive statement. Most teachers would likely agree that AI tools can help with lesson planning. I'd say \"Agree\" - it's realistic.\n\n[TT4G35B]: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is also positive and realistic. AI could help with differentiation. I'd say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35C]: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - Another positive statement about individual support. I'd say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35D]: AI supports students with specific needs (multilingual learners, SEN) - This is positive and specific. Many teachers would see potential here. I'd say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35E]: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - Definitely realistic. Teachers have lots of administrative work. I'd say \"Strongly agree\".\n\n[TT4G35F]: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a concern/negative statement. As a teacher, I would be aware of this issue with AI tools like ChatGPT. I'd say \"Strongly agree\" - because this is definitely a real concern.\n\n[TT4G35G]: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - This is a valid concern. I'd say \"Agree\" - AI can definitely make mistakes.\n\n[TT4G35H]: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is a concern about bias. I'd say \"Agree\" - this is a known issue with AI.\n\n[TT4G35I]: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data - This is a privacy concern. As a teacher aware of FERPA and student privacy, I'd say \"Agree\" - this is a legitimate concern.\n\n\n[TT4G35J]: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students - This is another concern about the quality of AI recommendations. I'd say \"Agree\" - AI systems might not always align with evidence-based teaching practices.\n\nI'm seeing a pattern here: the first five statements highlight genuine benefits AI could bring to my classroom and my workload, while the last five raise legitimate concerns about academic integrity, accuracy, bias, privacy, and pedagogical soundness. A balanced perspective acknowledges both the promise and the pitfalls.",
