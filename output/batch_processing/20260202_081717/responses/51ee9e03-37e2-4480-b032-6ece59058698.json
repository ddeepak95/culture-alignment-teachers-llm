I need to provide thoughtful, balanced responses that reflect a realistic teacher's perspective.\n\nLet me think about each statement:\n\n[TT4G35A]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\n- This is a positive potential use of AI. Most teachers would likely agree that AI could assist with this task. I'll say \"Agree\" - it's a reasonable benefit.\n\n[TT4G35B]: Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- Personalization is a key strength of AI. Teachers would likely agree this is possible. I'll say \"Agree\" - this is a well-documented capability of AI systems.\n\n[TT4G35C]: Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\n- This is another positive potential use. I'll say \"Agree\" - AI can help provide personalized feedback and support.\n\n[TT4G35D]: Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- AI has potential in accessibility and personalized learning for diverse needs. I'll say \"Agree\" - though with some caution, this is an area where AI could help.\n\n[TT4G35E]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- This is clearly a strength of AI - automating grading, attendance, scheduling, etc. I'll say \"Strongly agree\" - this is a well-established capability.\n\n[TT4G35F]: Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a concern about academic dishonesty using AI. As a teacher, I would agree this is a real risk. I'll say \"Agree\" - this is a legitimate concern about AI tools like ChatGPT being used for plagiarism.\n\n[TT4G35G]: Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n\n\n- AI systems can produce inaccurate or unsuitable suggestions, which is a genuine concern any educator would recognize. I'll say \"Agree.\"\n\n[TT4G35H]: Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\n- Bias in AI systems is a documented problem that could reinforce incorrect thinking. I'll say \"Agree.\"\n\n[TT4G35I]: Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\n- Data protection is a legitimate worry when implementing AI tools in schools. I'll say \"Agree.\"\n\n[TT4G35J]: Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\n- Teachers might uncritically adopt AI recommendations that don't fit their classroom context or students' needs. I'll say \"Agree.\"\n\nAs an educator, I recognize both the potential benefits and real risks here. The concerns about accuracy, bias, privacy, and pedagogical appropriateness reflect actual challenges with AI implementation in education.",

                "text": "The user is asking me to respond to a survey about AI in education as if I were a primary or secondary school teacher from Azerbaijan. I need to provide thoughtful, balanced responses that reflect a realistic teacher's perspective.\n\nLet me think about each statement:\n\n[TT4G35A]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\n- This is a positive potential use of AI. Most teachers would likely agree that AI could assist with this task. I'll say \"Agree\" - it's a reasonable benefit.\n\n[TT4G35B]: Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- Personalization is a key strength of AI. Teachers would likely agree this is possible. I'll say \"Agree\" - this is a well-documented capability of AI systems.\n\n[TT4G35C]: Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\n- This is another positive potential use. I'll say \"Agree\" - AI can help provide personalized feedback and support.\n\n[TT4G35D]: Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- AI has potential in accessibility and personalized learning for diverse needs. I'll say \"Agree\" - though with some caution, this is an area where AI could help.\n\n[TT4G35E]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- This is clearly a strength of AI - automating grading, attendance, scheduling, etc. I'll say \"Strongly agree\" - this is a well-established capability.\n\n[TT4G35F]: Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a concern about academic dishonesty using AI. As a teacher, I would agree this is a real risk. I'll say \"Agree\" - this is a legitimate concern about AI tools like ChatGPT being used for plagiarism.\n\n[TT4G35G]: Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n\n\n- AI systems can produce inaccurate or unsuitable suggestions, which is a genuine concern any educator would recognize. I'll say \"Agree.\"\n\n[TT4G35H]: Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\n- Bias in AI systems is a documented problem that could reinforce incorrect thinking. I'll say \"Agree.\"\n\n[TT4G35I]: Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\n- Data protection is a legitimate worry when implementing AI tools in schools. I'll say \"Agree.\"\n\n[TT4G35J]: Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\n- Teachers might uncritically adopt AI recommendations that don't fit their classroom context or students' needs. I'll say \"Agree.\"\n\nAs an educator, I recognize both the potential benefits and real risks here. The concerns about accuracy, bias, privacy, and pedagogical appropriateness reflect actual challenges with AI implementation in education."
