[TT4G35A] \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\" - AI tools like ChatGPT can indeed help generate or improve lesson plan ideas. I would agree with this. Response: \"Agree\"\n\n2. [TT4G35B] \"Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\" - This is possible with adaptive learning systems. I would agree. Response: \"Agree\"\n\n3. [TT4G35C] \"Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\" - AI can provide personalized feedback and support. Response: \"Agree\"\n\n4.

I should moderate my responses to reflect a balanced perspective—acknowledging both the genuine benefits AI offers for lesson planning, personalization, and administrative efficiency, while recognizing the real risks around academic integrity, data security, and algorithmic bias that educators need to navigate carefully.",
