I need to provide responses for each of the 10 statements using one of the five response options: 'Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', 'I don't know'.\n\nI should approach this thoughtfully from the perspective of a teacher considering both the benefits and risks of AI in education. Let me think through each statement:\n\n[TT4G35A]: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is a positive use case that many teachers would agree is helpful. Response: Agree\n\n[TT4G35B]: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is a valuable capability for personalized learning. Response: Agree\n\n[TT4G35C]: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - Another positive aspect of AI. Response: Agree\n\n[TT4G35D]: AI supports students with specific needs (multilingual learners, SEN) - This is a particularly beneficial application. Response: Strongly agree\n\n[TT4G35E]: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - Teachers often spend significant time on admin, and AI could help. Response: Agree\n\n[TT4G35F]: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a risk/concern. As a teacher, I would acknowledge this is a real concern. Response: Agree (acknowledging this is a real problem)\n\n[TT4G35G]: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - This is a valid concern about AI accuracy and reliability. Response: Agree\n\n[TT4G35H]: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is a legitimate concern about AI bias. Response: Agree\n\n[TT4G35I]: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data - This is a significant concern for educators. Response: Strongly agree\n\n[TT4G35J]: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students - This is a concern about inappropriate teaching methods.
