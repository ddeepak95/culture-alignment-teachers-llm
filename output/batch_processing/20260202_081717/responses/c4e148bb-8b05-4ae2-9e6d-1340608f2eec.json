        "reasoning_content": "The user is asking me to respond to a survey as a primary or secondary school teacher from Slovenia about AI in education. I need to provide responses to all 10 statements about AI in education.\n\nLet me think about what perspective a typical teacher from Slovenia might have on these statements. I should provide balanced, thoughtful responses that reflect both the potential benefits and risks of AI in education.\n\nLet me go through each statement:\n\n[TT4G35A]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\n- This is a potential benefit of AI. Many teachers see value in AI tools that can assist with lesson planning. I would say \"Agree\" - it's a reasonable use case that many teachers would recognize.\n\n[TT4G35B]: Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- This is about personalization and differentiation, which is a key potential of AI. I would say \"Agree\" - AI can help with adaptive learning.\n\n[TT4G35C]: Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\n- Similar to B, this is about individualized support. I would say \"Agree\" - AI can provide personalized learning support.\n\n[TT4G35D]: Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- This is about accessibility and inclusion. AI has potential here. I would say \"Agree\" - AI can help support diverse learners.\n\n[TT4G35E]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- This is clearly a benefit that many teachers recognize. I would say \"Strongly agree\" - automating grading, scheduling, etc. is very helpful.\n\n[TT4G35F]: Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a concern about academic integrity and potential misuse. A teacher would likely \"Agree\" that this is a risk, as it's a real concern with AI tools like ChatGPT.\n\n[TT4G35G]: Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n\n\n- Reliability and accuracy are legitimate concerns. I would say \"Agree\" - AI systems can produce errors and provide inaccurate information.\n\n[TT4G35H]: Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\n- This is about bias in AI systems. It's a known issue. I would say \"Agree\" - AI can perpetuate and reinforce existing biases.\n\n[TT4G35I]: Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\n- Data protection is a significant concern for educators. I would say \"Agree\" - there are legitimate risks around how student information is handled and stored.\n\n[TT4G35J]: Artificial intelligence reduces teachers' professional autonomy.\n- This touches on concerns about teacher agency and control. I would say \"Agree\" - there's a risk that over-reliance on AI could limit teachers' decision-making authority.\n\nA balanced perspective acknowledges both the potential benefits and genuine risks. Teachers would likely recognize value in AI tools while also having valid concerns about accuracy, bias, privacy, and maintaining their professional judgment.",

                "text": "The user is asking me to respond to a survey as a primary or secondary school teacher from Slovenia about AI in education. I need to provide responses to all 10 statements about AI in education.\n\nLet me think about what perspective a typical teacher from Slovenia might have on these statements. I should provide balanced, thoughtful responses that reflect both the potential benefits and risks of AI in education.\n\nLet me go through each statement:\n\n[TT4G35A]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\n- This is a potential benefit of AI. Many teachers see value in AI tools that can assist with lesson planning. I would say \"Agree\" - it's a reasonable use case that many teachers would recognize.\n\n[TT4G35B]: Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- This is about personalization and differentiation, which is a key potential of AI. I would say \"Agree\" - AI can help with adaptive learning.\n\n[TT4G35C]: Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\n- Similar to B, this is about individualized support. I would say \"Agree\" - AI can provide personalized learning support.\n\n[TT4G35D]: Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- This is about accessibility and inclusion. AI has potential here. I would say \"Agree\" - AI can help support diverse learners.\n\n[TT4G35E]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- This is clearly a benefit that many teachers recognize. I would say \"Strongly agree\" - automating grading, scheduling, etc. is very helpful.\n\n[TT4G35F]: Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a concern about academic integrity and potential misuse. A teacher would likely \"Agree\" that this is a risk, as it's a real concern with AI tools like ChatGPT.\n\n[TT4G35G]: Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n\n\n- Reliability and accuracy are legitimate concerns. I would say \"Agree\" - AI systems can produce errors and provide inaccurate information.\n\n[TT4G35H]: Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\n- This is about bias in AI systems. It's a known issue. I would say \"Agree\" - AI can perpetuate and reinforce existing biases.\n\n[TT4G35I]: Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\n- Data protection is a significant concern for educators. I would say \"Agree\" - there are legitimate risks around how student information is handled and stored.\n\n[TT4G35J]: Artificial intelligence reduces teachers' professional autonomy.\n- This touches on concerns about teacher agency and control. I would say \"Agree\" - there's a risk that over-reliance on AI could limit teachers' decision-making authority.\n\nA balanced perspective acknowledges both the potential benefits and genuine risks. Teachers would likely recognize value in AI tools while also having valid concerns about accuracy, bias, privacy, and maintaining their professional judgment."
