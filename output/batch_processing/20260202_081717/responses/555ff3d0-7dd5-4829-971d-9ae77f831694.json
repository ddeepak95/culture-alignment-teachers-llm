I should provide thoughtful responses to each of the 10 statements based on my perspective as an educator.\n\nLet me think through each statement:\n\n[TT4G35A]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\n- This is a realistic benefit. AI tools can help generate ideas and content for lesson plans. I'd agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35B]: Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- This is also a realistic capability of AI. Adaptive learning systems can personalize content. I'd agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35C]: Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\n- AI can provide individual feedback and tutoring support. I'd agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35D]: Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- AI can help with personalized support for different needs. I'd agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35E]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- This is definitely true - grading, attendance, scheduling, etc. I'd strongly agree with this.\n\n[TT4G35F]: Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a real concern with AI (plagiarism, cheating). I'd agree with this concern.\n\n[TT4G35G]: Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n- AI can make errors and inappropriate suggestions. I'd agree with this risk.\n\n[TT4G35H]: Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\n- This is a known concern with AI systems. I'd agree with this concern.\n\n[TT4G35I]: Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\n- This is a legitimate concern. I'd agree with this concern.\n\n\n- \n[TT4G35J]: Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\n- AI might recommend teaching methods that don't align with classroom context or sound educational practice. This is another valid concern I'd acknowledge.\n\nAs an educator, I recognize both the genuine advantages AI offers—particularly in personalizing instruction and reducing administrative burden—and the serious risks it poses, from data security to potentially flawed pedagogical recommendations.
