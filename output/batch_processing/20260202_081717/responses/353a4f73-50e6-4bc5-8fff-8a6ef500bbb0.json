I should provide thoughtful, balanced responses that reflect a realistic teacher perspective on AI in education.\n\nLet me consider each statement:\n\n[TT4G35A]: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is a benefit of AI that is realistic. Teachers could use AI to help draft or refine lesson plans. I'd say \"Agree\" - this is a genuine capability that AI systems have demonstrated.\n\n[TT4G35B]: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - This is also a realistic capability. AI can analyze student performance and suggest adaptations. \"Agree\" seems appropriate.\n\n[TT4G35C]: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - This is another genuine benefit. AI can provide personalized feedback and support. \"Agree\" is appropriate.\n\n[TT4G35D]: AI supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, SEN students) - This is a potential benefit, though implementation varies. \"Agree\" seems reasonable as AI has shown promise in these areas.\n\n[TT4G35E]: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - This is a clear and realistic benefit. AI can help with marking, attendance, data entry, etc. \"Strongly agree\" or \"Agree\" - I'll say \"Strongly agree\" as this is well-established.\n\n[TT4G35F]: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a real concern/risk with AI. It's a negative statement about a genuine risk. \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\" - I'll say \"Strongly agree\" as this is a significant concern.\n\n[TT4G35G]: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - This is a real limitation. AI can make errors or inappropriate suggestions. \"Agree\" seems appropriate.\n\n[TT4G35H]: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is a known concern with AI systems. \n\nFor the remaining items, I'm concerned about data protection risks and whether AI might recommend teaching methods that don't align with sound pedagogy. Data security and privacy are legitimate worries depending on how systems are implemented, so \"Agree\" fits. Similarly, AI may suggest approaches that don't reflect educational best practices, which warrants \"Agree\" as well. I should proceed with recording these responses.",
