AI tools can help generate ideas, structure lessons, etc. Most would probably agree or strongly agree.\n\n[TT4G35B]: Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- Yes, AI can personalize learning and adapt to different levels. This is a known capability. Agree or Strongly agree.\n\n[TT4G35C]: Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\n- Yes, AI can provide individual feedback, tutoring, etc. Agree or Strongly agree.\n\n[TT4G35D]: Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- AI has potential here for personalization. Agree or Strongly agree.\n\n[TT4G35E]: Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- Yes, definitely. Teachers spend a lot of time on admin. Strongly agree.\n\n[TT4G35F]: Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a risk/concern. Would likely Agree or Strongly agree that this is a risk.\n\n[TT4G35G]: Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n- Yes, AI can make mistakes or inappropriate suggestions. Agree or Strongly agree.\n\n[TT4G35H]: Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\n- This is a known concern. \n\n[TT4G35I]: Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\n- This is a legitimate concern. Agree or Strongly agree.\n\n[TT4G35J]: Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\n- This could happen. Agree or Strongly agree.\n\nAs a teacher in Belgium, I should provide balanced responses reflecting both the benefits and risks of AI. The first five statements highlight genuine advantages—from streamlining lesson preparation to supporting diverse learners and reducing administrative burden. The remaining five address legitimate concerns around academic integrity, accuracy, bias, data protection, and pedagogical appropriateness. My responses should acknowledge both the promise and the pitfalls of AI in educational settings.",
