Most teachers would \"Agree\" this is a risk.\n\n[TT4G35G]: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - This is true, AI can make mistakes. \"Agree\" is reasonable.\n\n[TT4G35H]: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is a known concern about AI bias. \"Agree\" seems appropriate.\n\n[TT4G35I]: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data - This is a significant concern for teachers. \n\n[TT4G35J]: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches - This could happen with AI systems. \"Agree\" seems reasonable as a concern.\n\nFor the remaining items, I need to consider how implementation details affect my responses.
