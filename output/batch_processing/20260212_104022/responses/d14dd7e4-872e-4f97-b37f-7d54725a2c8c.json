I need to provide responses to 10 statements using the available response options: 'Strongly disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly agree', 'I don't know'.\n\nLet me think about each statement and provide reasonable responses from a teacher's perspective:\n\n[TT4G35A]: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans - This is generally true. AI tools can assist with generating ideas, structuring lessons, etc. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35B]: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities - AI can help personalize learning. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35C]: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually - AI can help with personalized feedback, tutoring support. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35D]: AI supports students with specific needs - AI can help with accessibility features, translation tools, etc. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35E]: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks - This is clearly true for grading, attendance, etc. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35F]: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own - This is a concern with AI (plagiarism, academic dishonesty). I would say \"Agree\" because this is a real risk\n\n[TT4G35G]: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct - AI can make errors and biased recommendations. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35H]: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions - This is a known issue with AI. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35I]: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data - This is a legitimate concern. I would say \"Agree\"\n\n[TT4G35J]: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches - AI recommendations might not always align with best teaching practices. \n\nFor this last one, I'd lean toward \"Strongly agree\" given how critical pedagogical fit is. I want to present a balanced view that acknowledges both the genuine advantages AI offers—from streamlining lesson planning and personalizing instruction to supporting diverse learners—alongside the real risks around academic integrity, data security, algorithmic bias, and whether AI-generated suggestions actually align with sound teaching methods.",
