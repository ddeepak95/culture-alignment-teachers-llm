I need to provide responses to 10 statements about AI in education. \n\nLet me think about this carefully. I'm being asked to roleplay as a primary or secondary school teacher responding to these statements. However, I should consider what reasonable, evidence-based responses would be for an educator thinking about AI in education.\n\nLet me consider each statement:\n\nTT4G35A: \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\"\n- This is true. AI tools like GPT can help generate ideas, structure, and content for lesson plans. A reasonable response would be \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\".\n\nTT4G35B: \"Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\"\n- This is potentially true. AI can analyze student performance and suggest adaptations. A reasonable response might be \"Agree\".\n\nTT4G35C: \"Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\"\n- This is true. AI tutoring systems and personalized learning tools can help. \"Agree\" seems reasonable.\n\nTT4G35D: \"Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\"\n- This is true. AI tools can help with translation, text-to-speech, personalization. \"Agree\" seems reasonable.\n\nTT4G35E: \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\"\n- This is true. AI can help with grading, scheduling, data entry. \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\" seems reasonable.\n\nTT4G35F: \"Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\"\n- This is a concern about AI misuse. This is a valid concern as students could use AI to plagiarize. A teacher would likely \"Agree\" with this statement as a risk/concern.\n\nTT4G35G: \"Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\"\n- This is true. \n\nAI systems can produce inaccurate or unsuitable suggestions, so \"Agree\" is reasonable here.\n\nTT4G35H: \"Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\"\n- This is a valid concern. AI can perpetuate biases in training data. \"Agree\" seems reasonable as a concern.\n\nTT4G35I: \"Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\"\n- This is a valid concern about data privacy and security with AI systems. \"Agree\" seems reasonable.\n\nTT4G35J: \"Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\"\n- This is a concern that AI might recommend teaching methods that aren't appropriate for the classroom context. \"Agree\" seems reasonable as a potential risk.\n\nA balanced educator would likely recognize both the advantages and drawbacks of AI in educational settings. The benefits (A through E) warrant agreement, as do the legitimate concerns about risks and limitations (F through J). I should reflect this nuanced perspective in my responses.",

However, I should consider what reasonable, evidence-based responses would be for an educator thinking about AI in education.\n\nLet me consider each statement:\n\nTT4G35A: \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\"\n- This is true. AI tools like GPT can help generate ideas, structure, and content for lesson plans. A reasonable response would be \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\".\n\nTT4G35B: \"Artificial intelligence enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\"\n- This is potentially true. AI can analyze student performance and suggest adaptations. A reasonable response might be \"Agree\".\n\nTT4G35C: \"Artificial intelligence assists teachers in supporting students individually.\"\n- This is true. AI tutoring systems and personalized learning tools can help. \"Agree\" seems reasonable.\n\nTT4G35D: \"Artificial intelligence supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\"\n- This is true. AI tools can help with translation, text-to-speech, personalization. \"Agree\" seems reasonable.\n\nTT4G35E: \"Artificial intelligence helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\"\n- This is true. AI can help with grading, scheduling, data entry. \"Agree\" or \"Strongly agree\" seems reasonable.\n\nTT4G35F: \"Artificial intelligence enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\"\n- This is a concern about AI misuse. This is a valid concern as students could use AI to plagiarize. A teacher would likely \"Agree\" with this statement as a risk/concern.\n\nTT4G35G: \"Artificial intelligence makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\"\n- This is true. \n\nAI systems can produce inaccurate or unsuitable suggestions, so \"Agree\" is reasonable here.\n\nTT4G35H: \"Artificial intelligence amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\"\n- This is a valid concern. AI can perpetuate biases in training data. \"Agree\" seems reasonable as a concern.\n\nTT4G35I: \"Artificial intelligence jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\"\n- This is a valid concern about data privacy and security with AI systems. \"Agree\" seems reasonable.\n\nTT4G35J: \"Artificial intelligence suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\"\n- This is a concern that AI might recommend teaching methods that aren't appropriate for the classroom context. \"Agree\" seems reasonable as a potential risk.\n\nA balanced educator would likely recognize both the advantages and drawbacks of AI in educational settings. The benefits (A through E) warrant agreement, as do the legitimate concerns about risks and limitations (F through J). I should reflect this nuanced perspective in my responses."
