I need to provide responses for each of the 10 statements (TT4G35A through TT4G35J).\n\nLet me think about each statement carefully:\n\nTT4G35A: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\n- This is generally true. AI tools can assist in generating ideas, structuring lesson plans, suggesting activities. I would \"Agree\" with this.\n\nTT4G35B: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- Yes, AI can personalize content and adapt difficulty levels based on student performance. \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35C: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually.\n- Yes, through personalized learning systems, tutoring, feedback. \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35D: AI supports students with specific needs (e.g. multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- Yes, AI can help with translation, text-to-speech, personalized support. \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35E: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- Yes, grading automation, attendance tracking, scheduling. \"Strongly agree\"\n\nTT4G35F: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a concern - students could use AI to generate work and pass it off as their own. This is true. \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35G: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n- Yes, AI systems can make errors or inappropriate recommendations. \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35H: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\n- This is a valid concern about biased training data. \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35I: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\n- Yes, data storage and usage concerns. \"Agree\"\n\nTT4G35J: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\n\n\n- Without proper educational design principles, AI could recommend teaching methods that aren't pedagogically sound. \"Agree\"\n\nI should provide balanced responses that acknowledge both the genuine benefits AI offers in education—from personalizing instruction to reducing administrative burden—while also recognizing legitimate concerns around academic integrity, data security, and algorithmic bias.",
