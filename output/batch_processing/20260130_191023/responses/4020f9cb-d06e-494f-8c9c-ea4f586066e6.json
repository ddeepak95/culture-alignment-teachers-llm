I need to provide responses for each of the 10 statements using the response options provided: \"Strongly disagree\", \"Disagree\", \"Agree\", \"Strongly agree\", or \"I don't know\".\n\nLet me think about each statement from the perspective of a teacher in the UAE:\n\n[TT4G35A]: AI helps teachers write or improve lesson plans.\n- This is generally true. AI tools like ChatGPT can help teachers create and improve lesson plans. I would say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35B]: AI enables teachers to adapt learning material to different students' abilities.\n- This is also true. AI can personalize content for different learning levels. I would say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35C]: AI assists teachers in supporting students individually.\n- Yes, AI can provide personalized learning support. I would say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35D]: AI supports students with specific needs (e.g., multilingual learners, students with special education needs).\n- This is true. AI has potential to support diverse learners. I would say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35E]: AI helps teachers automate administrative tasks.\n- This is definitely true. AI can help with grading, attendance, scheduling, etc. I would say \"Strongly agree\".\n\n[TT4G35F]: AI enables students to misrepresent others' work as their own.\n- This is a concern/risk with AI. Students could use AI-generated work and pass it off as their own. This is a problem/disadvantage. I would say \"Agree\" (it is a valid concern).\n\n[TT4G35G]: AI makes recommendations that may not be appropriate or correct.\n- This is a known limitation of AI - it can make errors or inappropriate suggestions. I would say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35H]: AI amplifies biases that reinforce students' misconceptions.\n\n\n- AI bias is a legitimate concern that could reinforce existing misconceptions. I would say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35I]: AI jeopardises the privacy and security of student data.\n- Data collection and security risks are real concerns with AI systems. I would say \"Agree\".\n\n[TT4G35J]: AI suggests unsuitable pedagogical approaches that teachers would use with students.\n- AI might recommend methods that don't fit the specific context or student population. I would say \"Agree\".\n\nLet me now create the function call with these responses.",
